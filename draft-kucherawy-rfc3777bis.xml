		<t> The process by which the members of the IAB and IESG
		    are selected, confirmed, and recalled is specified in
		    this document.  This document is a self-consistent,
		    organized compilation of the process as it was known

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> This document is a revision of and supercedes
		    <xref target="RFC3777"/>.  It is a complete specification
		    of the process by which members of the IAB and IESG
		    are selected, confirmed, and recalled as of the date
		    of its approval. </t>

		<t> The following two assumptions continue to be true of this
		    specification:

		    <list style="numbers">
			<t> The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and
			    Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG) are not a
			    part of the process described here. </t>

			<t> The organization (and re-organization) of the IESG
			    is not a part of the process described here. </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> The time frames specified here use IETF meetings as
		    a frame of reference.  The time frames assume that the
		    IETF meets three times per calendar year with
		    approximately equal amounts of time between them.  The
		    meetings are referred to as the First IETF, Second IETF,
		    or Third IETF as needed. </t>

		<t> The next section lists the words and phrases commonly used
		    throughout this document with their intended meaning. </t>

		<t> The majority of this document is divided into four major
		    topics as follows:

		    <list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="General:"> This a set of rules and
				constraints that apply to the selection and
				confirmation process as a whole. </t>

			<t hangText="Nominating Committee Selection:"> This

				selected. </t>

			<t hangText="Nominating Committee Operation:"> This
				is the set of principles, rules, and
				constraints that guide the activities of
				the nominating committee, including the
				confirmation process. </t>

			<t hangText="Member Recall:"> This is the process by
				which the behavior of a sitting member of the
				IESG or IAB may be questioned, perhaps
				resulting in the removal of the sitting
				member. </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> A final section describes how this document differs from
		    its predecessor <xref target="RFC3777"/>. </t>

		<t> An appendix of useful facts and practices collected from
		    previous nominating committees is also included. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="defs" title="Definitions">
		<t> The following words and phrases are commonly used
		    throughout this document.  They are listed here with
		    their intended meaning for the convenience of the

	<section anchor="general" title="General">
		<t> The following set of rules apply to the process as a
		    whole.  If necessary, a paragraph discussing the
		    interpretation of each rule is included. </t>

		<section anchor="gen_completion" title="Completion Due">
			<t> The completion of the annual process is due
			    within seven months. </t>

			<t> The completion of the annual process is due
			    one month prior to the Friday of the week
			    before the First IETF.  It is expected to begin
			    at least eight months prior to the Friday of the
			    week before the First IETF. </t>

			<t> The process officially begins with the
			    announcement of the Chair of the committee.
			    The process officially ends when all confirmed
			    candidates have been announced. </t>

			<t> The annual process is comprised of three major
			    components as follows:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> The selection and organization of the
				    nominating committee members. </t>

				<t> The selection of candidates by the
				    nominating committee. </t>

				<t> The confirmation of the candidates. </t>
			    </list> </t>

			<t> There is an additional month set aside between
			    when the annual process is expected to end and
			    the term of the new candidates is to begin.  This
			    time may be used during unusual circumstances to
			    extend the time allocated for any of the
			    components listed above. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="gen_func"
		         title="Nominating Committee Principal Functions">
			<t> The principal functions of the nominating
			    committee are to review each open IESG and IAB
			    position and to either nominate its incumbent or
			    a superior candidate. </t>

			<t> Although there is no term limit for serving in
			    any IESG or IAB position, the nominating committee
			    may use length of service as one of its criteria
			    for evaluating an incumbent. </t>

			<t> The nominating committee does not select the
			    open positions to be reviewed; it is instructed
			    as to which positions to review. </t>

			<t> The nominating committee will be given the title
			    of the positions to be reviewed and a brief
			    summary of the desired expertise of the candidate
			    that is nominated to fill each position. </t>

			<t> Incumbents must notify the nominating committee
			    if they wish to be nominated. </t>

			<t> The nominating committee does not confirm its
			    candidates; it presents its candidates to the
			    appropriate confirming body as indicated
			    below. </t>

			<t> A superior candidate is one who the nominating
			    committee believes would contribute in such a
			    way as to improve or enhance the body to which
			    he or she is nominated. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="gen_positions"
		         title="Positions To Be Reviewed">
			<t> One-half of each of the then current IESG and
			    IAB positions is selected to be reviewed each
			    year. </t>

			<t> The intent of this rule to ensure the review of
			    approximately one-half of each of the IESG and IAB
			    sitting members each year.  It is recognized that
			    circumstances may exist that will require the
			    nominating committee to review more or less than
			    one-half of the current positions, e.g., if the
			    IESG or IAB have re-organized prior to this
			    process and created new positions, if there are
			    an odd number of current positions, or if a member
			    unexpectedly resigns. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="gen_terms" title="Term Lengths">
			<t> Confirmed candidates are expected to serve at
			    least a two year term. </t>

			<t> The intent of this rule is to ensure that members
			    of the IESG and IAB serve the number of years
			    that best facilitates the review of one-half of
			    the members each year. </t>

			<t> The term of a confirmed candidate selected
			    according to the mid-term vacancy rules may be
			    less than two years, as stated elsewhere in this
			    document. </t>

			<t> It is consistent with this rule for the nominating
			    committee to choose one or more of the currently
			    open positions to which it may assign a term of
			    not more than three years in order to ensure the
			    ideal application of this rule in the future. </t>

			<t> It is consistent with this rule for the nominating
			    committee to choose one or more of the currently
			    open positions that share responsibilities with
			    other positions (both those being reviewed and
			    those sitting) to which it may assign a term of
			    not more than three years to ensure that all such
			    members will not be reviewed at the same time. </t>

			<t> All sitting member terms end during the First IETF
			    meeting corresponding to the end of the term for
			    which they were confirmed.  All confirmed
			    candidate terms begin during the First IETF
			    meeting corresponding to the beginning of the term
			    for which they were confirmed. </t>

			<t> For confirmed candidates of the IESG the terms
			    begin no later than when the currently sitting
			    members' terms end on the last day of the meeting.
			    A term may begin or end no sooner than the first
			    day of the meeting and no later than the last day
			    of the meeting as determined by the mutual
			    agreement of the currently sitting member and the 
			    confirmed candidate.  A confirmed candidate's term
			    may overlap the sitting member's term during the
			    meeting as determined by their mutual
			    agreement. </t>

			<t> For confirmed candidates of the IAB the terms
			    overlap with the terms of the sitting members for
			    the entire week of the meeting. </t>

			<t> For candidates confirmed under the mid-term
			    vacancy rules, the term begins as soon as possible
			    after the confirmation. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="gen_vacancies" title="Mid-Term Vacancies">
			<t> Mid-term vacancies are filled by the same rules
			    as documented here with four qualifications,
			    namely:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> When there is only one official nominating
				    committee, the body with the mid-term
				    vacancy relegates the responsibility to
				    fill the vacancy to it.  If the mid-term
				    vacancy occurs during the period of time
				    that the term of the prior year's
				    nominating committee overlaps with the
				    term of the current year's nominating
				    committee, the body with the mid-term
				    vacancy must relegate the responsibility
				    to fill the vacancy to the prior year's
				    nominating committee. </t>

				<t> If it is the case that the nominating
				    committee is reconvening to fill the
				    mid-term vacancy, then the completion of
				    the candidate selection and confirmation
				    process is due within six weeks, with all
				    other time periods otherwise unspecified
				    prorated accordingly. </t>

				<t> The confirming body has two weeks from the
				    day it is notified of a candidate to
				    reject the candidate, otherwise the
				    candidate is assumed to have been
				    confirmed. </t>

				<t> The term of the confirmed candidate will
				    be either:

				    <list style="letters">
					<t> the remainder of the term of the
					    open position if that remainder
					    is not less than one year; or </t>

					<t> the remainder of the term of the
					    open position plus the next two
					    year term if that remainder is
					    less than one year. </t>
				    </list> </t>
			        </list> </t>

			<t> In both cases a year is the period of time from a
			    First IETF meeting to the next First IETF
			    meeting. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="gen_confidential" title="Confidentiality">
			<t> All deliberations and supporting information that
			    relates to specific nominees, candidates, and
			    confirmed candidates are confidential. </t>

			<t> The nominating committee and confirming body
			    members will be exposed to confidential
			    information as a result of their deliberations,
			    their interactions with those they consult, and
			    from those who provide requested supporting
			    information.  All members and all other
			    participants are expected to handle this
			    information in a manner consistent with its
			    sensitivity. </t>

			<t> It is consistent with this rule for current
			    nominating committee members who have served on
			    prior nominating committees to advise the current
			    committee on deliberations and results of the
			    prior committee, as necessary and appropriate. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="gen_model" title="Advice and Consent Model">
			<t> Unless otherwise specified, the advice and
			    consent model is used throughout the process.
			    This model is characterized as follows. </t>

			<section anchor="gen_model_1"
			         title="Positions To Be Reviewed">
				<t> The IETF Executive Director informs the
				    nominating committee of the IESG and IAB

				<t> The IESG and IAB are responsible for
				    providing summary of the expertise desired
				    of the candidates selected for their
				    respective open positions to the Executive
				    Director.  The summaries are provided to
				    the nominating committee for its
				    consideration. </t>
			</section>

			<section anchor="gen_model_2"
			         title="Candidate Selection">
				<t> The nominating committee selects

				    qualifications required and advises each
				    confirming body of its respective
				    candidates. </t>
			</section>

			<section anchor="gen_model_3" title="Candidate Review">
				<t> The confirming bodies review their
				    respective candidates, they may at their

				<t> The sitting IAB members review the IESG
				    candidates. </t>

				<t> The Internet Society Board of Trustees
				    reviews the IAB candidates. </t>

				<t> The confirming bodies conduct their review
				    using all information and any means
				    acceptable to them, including but not
				    limited to the supporting information
				    provided by the nominating committee,
				    information known personally to members of
				    the confirming bodies and shared within
				    the confirming body, the results of
				    interactions within the confirming bodies,
				    and the confirming bodies interpretation
				    of what is in the best interests of the
				    IETF community. </t>

				<t> If all of the candidates are confirmed,
				    the job of the nominating committee with
				    respect to those open positions is
				    complete. </t>

				<t> If some or none of the candidates
				    submitted to a confirming body are
				    confirmed, the confirming body should
				    communicate with the nominating committee
				    both to explain the reason why all the
				    candidates were not confirmed and to
				    understand the nominating committee's
				    rationale for its candidates. </t>

				<t> The confirming body may reject individual
				    candidates, in which case the nominating
				    committee must select alternate candidates
				    for the rejected candidates. </t>

				<t> Any additional time required by the
				    nominating committee should not exceed its

			<section anchor="gen_model_4" title="Confirmation">
				<t> A confirming body decides whether it

				    confirming a given candidate should
				    require at least one-half of the
				    confirming body's sitting members to
				    agree to that confirmation. </t>

				<t> The decision may be made by conducting a

			</section>
		</section>

		<section anchor="gen_sitting" title="Sitting Members">
			<t> The following rules apply to nominees candidates
			    who are currently sitting members of the IESG or
			    IAB, and who are not sitting in an open position
			    being filled by the nominating committee. </t>

			<t> The confirmation of a candidate to an open
			    position does not automatically create a vacancy
			    in the IESG or IAB position currently occupied by
			    the candidate.  The mid-term vacancy can not exist
			    until, first, the candidate formally resigns from
			    the current position and, second, the body with
			    the vacancy formally decides for itself that it
			    wants the nominating committee to fill the
			    mid-term vacancy according to the rules for a
			    mid-term vacancy documented elsewhere in this
			    document. </t>

			<t> The resignation should be effective as of when
			    the term of the new position begins.  The
			    resignation may remain confidential to the IAB,
			    IESG, and nominating committee until the confirmed
			    candidate is announced for the new position.  The
			    process, according to rules set out elsewhere in
			    this document, of filling the seat vacated by the
			    confirmed candidate may begin as soon as the
			    vacancy is publicly announced. </t>

			<t> Filling a mid-term vacancy is a separate and
			    independent action from the customary action of
			    filling open positions.  In particular, a
			    nominating committee must complete its job with
			    respect to filling the open positions and then
			    separately proceed with the task of filling the
			    mid-term vacancy according to the rules for a
			    mid-term vacancy documented elsewhere in this
			    document. </t>

			<t> However, the following exception is permitted in
			    the case where the candidate for an open position
			    is currently a sitting member of the IAB.  It is
			    consistent with these rules for the announcements
			    of a resignation of a sitting member of the IAB
			    and of the confirmed candidate for the mid-term
			    vacancy created by that sitting member on the IAB
			    to all occur at the same time as long as the
			    actual sequence of events that occurred did so in
			    the following order:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> The nominating committee completes the
				    advice and consent process for the open
				    position being filled by the candidate
				    currently sitting on the IAB. </t>

				<t> The newly confirmed candidate resigns
				    from their current position on the
				    IAB. </t>

				<t> The IAB with the new mid-term vacancy
				    requests that the nominating committee
				    fill the position. </t>

				<t> The Executive Director of the IETF
				    informs the nominating committee of the
				    mid-term vacancy. </t>

				<t> The nominating committee acts on the
				    request to fill the mid-term vacancy. </t>

		<section anchor="sel_timeline" title="Timeline">
			<t> The completion of the process of selecting and

			    is due within three months. </t>

			<t> The completion of the selection and organization
			    process is due at least one month prior to the
			    Third IETF.  This ensures the nominating committee
			    is fully operational and available for interviews
			    and consultation during the Third IETF. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sel_term" title="Term">
			<t> The term of a nominating committee is expected to
			    be 15 months. </t>

			<t> It is the intent of this rule that the end of a
			    nominating committee's term overlap by
			    approximately three months the beginning of the
			    term of the next nominating committee. </t>

			<t> The term of a nominating committee begins when its
			    members are officially announced.  The term ends
			    at the Third IETF (not three meetings), i.e., the
			    IETF meeting after the next nominating committee's
			    term begins. </t>

			<t> A term is expected to begin at least two months
			    prior to the Third IETF to ensure the nominating
			    committee has at least one month to get organized
			    before preparing for the Third IETF. </t>

			<t> A nominating committee is expected to complete
			    any work-in-progress before it is dissolved at
			    the end of its term. </t>

			<t> During the period of time that the terms of the
			    nominating committees overlap, all mid-term
			    vacancies are to be relegated to the prior year's
			    nominating committee.  The prior year's nominating
			    committee has no other responsibilities during the
			    overlap period.  At all times other than the
			    overlap period there is exactly one official
			    nominating committee and it is responsible for
			    all mid-term vacancies. </t>

			<t> When the prior year's nominating committee is
			    filling a mid-term vacancy during the period of
			    time that the terms overlap, the nominating
			    committees operate independently.  However, some
			    coordination is needed between them.  Since the

			<t> A Chair, in consultation with the Internet
			    Society President, may appoint a temporary
			    substitute for the Chair position. </t>

			<t> There are a variety of ordinary circumstances
			    that may arise from time to time that could
			    result in a Chair being unavailable to oversee
			    the activities of the committee.  The Chair, in
			    consultation with the Internet Society President,
			    may appoint a substitute from a pool comprised of
			    the liaisons currently serving on the committee
			    and the prior year's Chair or designee. </t>

			<t> Any such appointment must be temporary and does
			    not absolve the Chair of any or all responsibility
			    for ensuring the nominating committee completes
			    its assigned duties in a timely fashion. </t>

	<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
		<t> Any selection, confirmation, or recall process
		    necessarily involves investigation into the qualifications
		    and activities of prospective candidates.  The
		    investigation may reveal confidential or otherwise private
		    information about candidates to those participating in the
		    process.  Each person who participates in any aspect of
		    the process must maintain the confidentiality of any and
		    all information not explicitly identified as suitable for
		    public dissemination. </t>

		<t> When the nominating committee decides it is necessary to
		    share confidential or otherwise private information with
		    others, the dissemination must be minimal and must
		    include a prior commitment from all persons consulted to
		    observe the same confidentiality rules as the nominating
		    committee itself. </t>
