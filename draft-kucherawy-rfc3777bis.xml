		<t> The process by which the members of the IAB and IESG
		    are selected, confirmed, and recalled is specified in
		    this document.  This document is a self-consistent,
		    organized compilation of the process as it was known
		    at the time of publication of <xref target="RFC3777"/>,
		    with various updates since that version was published. </t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> This document is a revision of and supercedes
		    <xref target="RFC3777"/>.  It is a complete specification
		    of the process by which members of the IAB and IESG
		    are selected, confirmed, and recalled as of the date
		    of its approval. </t>

		<t> The following two assumptions continue to be true of this
		    specification:

		    <list style="numbers">
			<t> The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and
			    Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG) are not a
			    part of the process described here. </t>

			<t> The organization (and re-organization) of the IESG
			    is not a part of the process described here. </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> The time frames specified here use IETF meetings as
		    a frame of reference.  The time frames assume that the
		    IETF meets three times per calendar year with
		    approximately equal amounts of time between them.  The
		    meetings are referred to as the First IETF, Second IETF,
		    or Third IETF as needed. </t>

		<t> The next section lists the words and phrases commonly used
		    throughout this document with their intended meaning. </t>

		<t> The majority of this document is divided into four major
		    topics as follows:

		    <list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="General:"> This a set of rules and
				constraints that apply to the selection and
				confirmation process as a whole. </t>

			<t hangText="Nominating Committee Selection:"> This
				is the process by which the volunteers who
				will serve on the committee are
				selected. </t>

			<t hangText="Nominating Committee Operation:"> This
				is the set of principles, rules, and
				constraints that guide the activities of
				the nominating committee, including the
				confirmation process. </t>

			<t hangText="Member Recall:"> This is the process by
				which the behavior of a sitting member of the
				IESG or IAB may be questioned, perhaps
				resulting in the removal of the sitting
				member. </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> A final section describes how this document differs from
		    its predecessor <xref target="RFC3777"/>. </t>

		<t> An appendix of useful facts and practices collected from
		    previous nominating committees is also included. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="defs" title="Definitions">
		<t> The following words and phrases are commonly used
		    throughout this document.  They are listed here with
		    their intended meaning for the convenience of the
		    reader.

		    <list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="candidate:"> A nominee who has been
				selected to be considered for confirmation by
				a confirming body. </t>

			<t hangText="confirmed candidate:"> A candidate that
				has been reviewed and approved by a
				confirming body. </t>

			<t hangText="nominating committee term:"> The term
				begins when its members are officially
				announced, which is expected to be prior to
				the Third IETF to ensure it is fully
				operational at the Third IETF.  The term ends
				at the Third IETF (not three meetings) after
				the next nominating committee's term
				begins. </t>

			<t hangText="nominee:"> A person who is being or has
				been considered for one or more open positions
				of the IESG or IAB. </t>

			<t hangText="sitting member:"> A person who is
				currently serving a term of membership in the
				IESG, IAB, or ISOC Board of Trustees. </t>
		    </list> </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="general" title="General">
		<t> The following set of rules apply to the process as a
		    whole.  If necessary, a paragraph discussing the
		    interpretation of each rule is included. </t>

		<section anchor="gen_completion" title="Completion Due">
			<t> The completion of the annual process is due
			    within seven months. </t>

			<t> The completion of the annual process is due
			    one month prior to the Friday of the week
			    before the First IETF.  It is expected to begin
			    at least eight months prior to the Friday of the
			    week before the First IETF. </t>

			<t> The process officially begins with the
			    announcement of the Chair of the committee.
			    The process officially ends when all confirmed
			    candidates have been announced. </t>

			<t> The annual process is comprised of three major
			    components as follows:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> The selection and organization of the
				    nominating committee members. </t>

				<t> The selection of candidates by the
				    nominating committee. </t>

				<t> The confirmation of the candidates. </t>
			    </list> </t>

			<t> There is an additional month set aside between
			    when the annual process is expected to end and
			    the term of the new candidates is to begin.  This
			    time may be used during unusual circumstances to
			    extend the time allocated for any of the
			    components listed above. </t>

	<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
		<t> Any selection, confirmation, or recall process
		    necessarily involves investigation into the qualifications
		    and activities of prospective candidates.  The
		    investigation may reveal confidential or otherwise private
		    information about candidates to those participating in the
		    process.  Each person who participates in any aspect of
		    the process must maintain the confidentiality of any and
		    all information not explicitly identified as suitable for
		    public dissemination. </t>

		<t> When the nominating committee decides it is necessary to
		    share confidential or otherwise private information with
		    others, the dissemination must be minimal and must
		    include a prior commitment from all persons consulted to
		    observe the same confidentiality rules as the nominating
		    committee itself. </t>
