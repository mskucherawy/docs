    <abstract>
      <t>While locating the target host in IPv4 is well defined, this process is unclear for sytems in IPv4 and IPv6 environemt. This specification extends <xref target="RFC5321">RFC&nbsp;5321</xref> to provide a standard way of selecting the target host in mixed environements.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Target host selection is discussed in <xref target="RFC5321">RFC&nbsp;5321</xref> and some operational experience is described in <xref target="RFC3974">RFC&nbsp;3974</xref>. However the process is unclear when selecting the target host in a mixed environment. This specification addresses this issue and also defines how a receiving MTA can indicate to a sendind MTA to fall back to IPv4 for a message.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Rationale">
        <t><xref target="RFC5321">RFC&nbsp;5321</xref> section 5.2 specifically discusses SMTP implementations taking into account 'local circumstances' when deciding which network addresses to use.  However, neither it nor [RFC3974] explore what 'local circumstances' should be evaluated or how they should be evaluated.  The result has thus far been an inconsistent set of SMTP client implementations.  Providing a guideline for how SMTP client implementations should handle various dual-stack situations will improve the stability of the network while we operate in a dual- stack mode (which will likely be for an extended period of time).</t>

    <section title="Locating the target host">
      <t>This part applies if one or more MX RR are found for a given name and if the sender-SMTP server is IPV4 and/or IPv6 capable.</t>

      <t>When a domain name associated with an MX RR is looked up and the associated data field obtained, the data field of that response MUST contain a domain name.  That domain name MUST be queried for A RR if the sender-SMTP is IPv4 capable and MUST be queried for AAAA RR if the sender-SMTP is IPv6 capable. A list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the SMTP servers to which the message should be directed is therefore built.</t>

      <t>When there are more than one MX RR associated to the given domain, the above process is done for each MX RR. An ordered list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses is then established using the MX RR preference. Lower numbers are more preferred than higher ones.</t>

      <t>The sender-SMTP server SHOULD first try all the IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) with higher preference (lower number) before the IP addresses with lower preference (higher number). The sender-SMTP server SHOULD try all the addresses up to a limit before deciding if the message is deliverable or not. the sender-SMTP server SHOULD try at least two addresses.</t>

      <t>For the same MX RR preference when there is more than one IP address (IPv4/IPv6) to be tried, the sender-SMTP SHOULD maintain an internal sub preference list based on the rate of successful delivery of messages and based on the speed of such delivery. If such internal sub preference list is not established or cannot be established then the sender-SMTP SHOULD try randomly any address within the same preference. Using this method the sender-SMTP will not prefer IP addresses it cannot connect to, or IP addresses with more rejection or latency. In some way this strategy is similar to web browsers that initiate connection to the web server using IPv4 and IPv6 and select the one with better response.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
