The Applications and Real Time Area (ART) sometimes receives proposals for
the development or update of specifications dealing with application-related
topics that do not have an obvious venue for that work.

The ART Area General Applications Working Group (APPSAWG) serves as a forum
for consideration of such work in the IETF.  APPSAWG does no protocol development
and, with few exceptions, also does no document development.  Rather, APPSAWG
will consider proposals for work of possible interest to ART, and will typically
do one of the following things with each:

* Direct the work to an existing Working Group (WG).
* Develop a proposal for a Birds of a Feather (BoF) session at a future IETF
  meeting.
* Develop a charter and establish consensus for a new WG or Exploratory Group.
  This option will primarily be used with fairly mature and well-defined efforts.
* Reject or defer the proposal.

This is similar to the operating format of the DISPATCH WG, but while that WG
focuses more on real time applications, APPSAWG focuses on more general
applications proposals.

At the discretion of the chairs or the ART Area Directors, documents can be
processed by APPSAWG when they are simple things like IANA registration actions.
Any such document whose scope grows beyond such a simple action will instead
be dispatched via one of the options listed above.
