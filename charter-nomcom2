Until recently, NomCom's operating procedures were defined across five
RFCs.  One NomCom 2014 member volunteered to take those disparate documents
and merge them into a single consolidated reference, RFC7437 (BCP10).  That
consolidation work was constrained to only the merge of those documents,
and allowed no changes.

A previous working group produced RFC3777, which was the primary of the
five previous documents.  Since then there have been ten NomComs and
summaries from the respective NomCom Chairs suggestion what has worked
and what changes might be helpful.  These, coupled with any feedback from
today's community, comprise suggestions to modernize and otherwise improve
RFC7437.

The working group will update RFC7437 using those sources of input.
RFC7437bis is already in the datatracker (draft-kucherawy-rfc7437bis) and
is the only intended product of this working group.  Work will be constrained
to structure and procedures of NomCom itself, and no changes to procedures
or structure of other bodies will be considered.

No other work is in scope.

Milestones:
- Jul 2016: RFC7437bis to the IESG for publication
