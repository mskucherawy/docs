	<abstract>
		<t> DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a handling agent
		    to affix a digital signature to an email message,
		    associating a domain name with that message using
		    cryptographic signing techniques.  The digital signature
		    typically covers most of a message's original portions,
		    although the specific choices for content hashing are
		    at the discretion of the signer.  DKIM signatures survive
		    simply email relaying but typically are invalidated by
		    processing through Mediators, such as mailing lists.
		    For such cases, the signer needs a way to indicate that a
		    valid signature from some third party was anticipated, and
		    constitutes an acceptable handling of the message.  This
		    enables a receiver to conclude that the content is
		    legitimately from that original signer, even though its
		    original signature no longer validates. </t>

		<t> This document defines a mechanism for improving the
		    ability to assess DKIM validity for such messages. </t>

	<section anchor="background" title="Background">
		<t> DomainKeys Identified Mail <xref target="RFC6376"/>
		    defines a mechanism whereby a verified domain name can be
		    attached to a message, using a cryptographic signature.
		    It does not, however, assert that this domain name matches
		    a domain name found anywhere else in the message. </t>

		<t> DKIM signature survival is usually successful through
		    basic email relaying nodes.  It also survives simple
		    Mediators, such as mailbox forwarding agents, because
		    they only modify the message envelope and do not modify
		    the original message header or body.  Transit through
		    other Mediators, such as mailing lists, is usually
		    problematic, because they modify portions of the message
		    covered by the signature and therefore invalidate it. </t>

		<t> When a receiver needs to determine whether a message was
		    legitimately processed by a purported original signer, a
		    mechanism is needed that is more likely to survive transit
		    through Mediators.  This need is especially strong for
		    environments wishing to enforce policy linkage between the
		    author, the author's domain and specific email service
		    providers, such as when the latter two are the same.  An
		    example of such a need is when that original signer
		    publishes policies concerning the use of its domain name.
		    Examples are ADSP <xref target="RFC5617"/> and
		    DMARC <xref target="I-D.KUCHERAWY-DMARC-BASE"/>.  These
		    policies cannot be applied properly when legitimate mail
		    for the original signer's domain cannot be validated by
		    the final Receiver.  The potential for malfunction
		    otherwise is described in Section 5.2 of
		    <xref target="RFC6377"/>. </t>

		<t> The issues with mailing lists and similar re-mailing
		    applications can be resolved by a mechanism that permits
		    the original signer's domain ("A") to indicate that some
		    other domain ("B") is explicitly permitted to re-sign
		    content generated by "A", such that a Receiver can observe
		    signaling from both "A" and "B" that this relationship
		    exists. </t>

		<t> An experimental attempt to do this appeared in
		    <xref target="RFC6541"/>.  The method presented there
		    imposes a burden on the original signing domain to publish
		    those relationships a priori, via the DNS.  This proved
		    cumbersome with poor scaling properties.  So, a mechanism
		    that does not have such an external dependency is
		    preferred. </t>

	<section anchor="defs" title="Definitions">
		<t> Numerous terms used here, especially "Author",
		    "Originator", "Receiver", and "Recipient", are defined in
		    <xref target="RFC5598"/>.  DKIM-related terminology, such
		    as "Signing Domain", are taken from the DKIM
		    specification <xref target="RFC6376"/>. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="descr" title="DKIM-Delegate Specification">
		<t> An email header field, called "DKIM-Delegate", is defined.
		    When present, it asserts an ephemeral relationship between
		    an original message signing domain and a later intermediary
		    (Mediator). </t>

		<section title="Design Summary">
			<t> An "Original Signer" (typically the Originator
			    serving the Author) affixes a DKIM signatures
			    to a message using whatever parameters it wishes.
			    In addition to this, it affixes a DKIM-Delegate
			    field that indicates an ephemeral relationship
			    exists between the Author domain and some set
			    of other domains that are expected to handle
			    the message.  Preferably, the Mediator also signs
			    the message, to provide a reliable confirmation of
			    handling by that Mediator.  If a Receiver finds
			    that the Original Signer's "normal" signature does
			    not validate or is missing, it can perform
			    DKIM-Delegate evaluation. </t>

			<t> The DKIM-Delegate field includes a hash and
			    a cryptographic signature, just like DKIM-Signature
			    fields do.  However, the only content covered
			    by the hash is the DKIM-Delegate field and its
			    parameters. </t>

			<t> In combination with DKIM signatures, this
			    mechanism can aid a receiver in assessing whether
			    the message was legitimately handled by the
			    intermediary and whether the message was likely to
			    have had a legitimate signature by the original
			    signing domain, even when that original signature
			    became invalid.  This makes it possible to
			    identify such messages separately from those
			    without these assurances, and thus permits
			    treating the latter with more skepticism. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="mech" title="Mechanism">
			<t> The specific mechanism operates as follows:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> A "Primary" DKIM Signature is affixed to a
				    message by a handling agent, identifying
				    the Originator's domain and using typical
				    signing choices, such as covering the
				    entire message content in the body hash.
				    (That is, it does not use the "l="
				    tag.) </t>

				<t> The signer adds a DKIM-Delegate header
				    field identifying the Originator's domain.
				    It also identifies the specific domain(s)
				    with which it wishes to claim an ephemeral
				    relationship.  The DKIM-Delegate field is
				    self-signed, as described below. </t>

				<t> The Originator transmits the message to
				    the Receiver in the usual way. </t>

				<t> If the Receiver is not a Mediator, then
				    normal DKIM processing occurs, and
				    DKIM-Delegate is ignored. </t>

				<t> An authorized Mediator SHOULD affix its
				    own, normal DKIM signature to the
				    message after making any content
				    modifications it is configured to
				    make and before re-sending the
				    message to new Receiver(s). </t>

				<t> The new Receiver attempts to validate the
				    Primary signature affixed by the original
				    signer.  If it is valid, the requirements
				    of this protocol are satisfied (and the
				    algorithm terminates here). </t>

				<t> The new Receiver attempts to validate the
				    DKIM-Delegate field affixed
				    by the original signer.  If it is not
				    valid, expired, or absent, the
				    requirements of this protocol cannot be
				    satisfied (and the algorithm terminates
				    here). </t>

				<t> The Receiver extracts the list of domains
				    authorized to re-sign for the Author
				    domain from the "t=" tag of the
				    DKIM-Delegate field.  Call this set
				    "D". </t>

				<t> The Receiver performs normal validation
				    checks of all other DKIM signatures on the
				    message that include the entire message
				    body in their body hashes, and stores the
				    set of domains from passing signatures in
				    set "S". </t>

				<t> If the intersection of "D" and "S" is not
				    empty, the requirements of this protocol
				    are satisfied; otherwise, the requirements
				    are not satisfied.  </t>
			    </list> </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="syntax" title="Syntax">
			<t> The content of the DKIM-Delegate header field is
			    a tag-list as defined in Section 3.2 of
			    <xref target="RFC6376"/>.  The valid tags are:

			    <list style="hanging">
				<t hangText="a="> Signature algorithm
					(plain-text; REQUIRED).
				    As in Section 3.5 of
				    <xref target="RFC6376"/>, this contains
				    a string that describes the signature
				    generation algorithm used by the
				    signer. </t>

				<t hangText="b="> Signature data
					(base64; REQUIRED).
				    As in Section 3.5 of
				    <xref target="RFC6376"/>, this contains
				    a digital signature of the content of this
				    header field.  The same syntax rules for
				    DKIM signatures apply here. </t>

				<t hangText="d="> Author domain
					(plain-text; REQUIRED).
				    This value names the domain of the Author,
				    which is delegating signing authority to
				    one or more other domains. </t>

				<t hangText="s="> Selector name
					(plain-text; REQUIRED).
				    As in Section 3.5 of
				    <xref target="RFC6376"/>, this names a
				    particular public/private key pair that is
				    used to sign and verify the content of
				    this header field.  It will be used to
				    construct a DNS query for a text
				    representation of the public key. </t>

				<t hangText="t="> Delegation target
					(plain-text; REQUIRED).
				    This value is a comma-separated list of
				    domain names to which the authority to
				    sign on behalf of the Author domain is
				    being delegated. </t>

				<t hangText="x="> Expiration time
					(plain-text unsigned decimal integer;
					 RECOMMENDED, default is no expiration)
				    As in Section 3.5 of
				    <xref target="RFC6376"/>, this specifies
				    a timestamp beyond which this header field
				    MAY be considered invalid. </t>
			    </list> </t>

			<t> As with DKIM itself, any other tag MUST be
			    ignored. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="prep" title="Preparation">
			<t> The content of a DKIM-Delegate field is prepared
			    for signing by applying the "relaxed" header
			    canonicalization scheme defined in Section 3.4.2 of
			    <xref target="RFC6376"/> and the algorithm
			    described in Section 3.7.  For DKIM-Delegate,
			    the only content that is hashed is the constructed
			    DKIM-Delegate field itself, with an empty "b="
			    tag; notably, there is no "v=" or "bh=" tag, so
			    these are omitted.  The signature, once generated,
			    is then added as the value of the "b=" tag. </t>

			<t> The Original Signer SHOULD use the same selector
			    (and, hence, signing key) for DKIM-Delegate fields
			    as it uses for Primary signatures so that Domain
			    Name Service caching can be used. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="verify" title="Verification">
			<t> A Receiver verifies the DKIM-Delegate field
			    by applying the general algorithm described in
			    Section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC6376"/> with the
			    following caveats:

			    <list style="symbols">
				<t> This specification has a subset of the
				    tags found in a DKIM-Signature.  Most
				    notably, DKIM-Delegate has no "v=",
				    "bh=", "c=", or "h=" tag. </t>
			    </list> </t>

			<t> A DKIM-Delegate field that verifies contains
			    an explicit list of domains authorized to sign
			    content for the Author domain.  The Receiver then
			    simply ensures that there is a valid DKIM-Signature
			    from one of the delegated domains before concluding
			    that the Author domain approved the content. </t>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section anchor="exp" title="Expiration">
		<t> The expiration time on the DKIM-Delegate field needs to be
		    long enough to permit evaluation by Receivers of the
		    re-submitted message, yet short enough to limit the
		    potential for unauthorized injection attacks.  A good
		    choice is a small number of days or even hours. </t>

		<t> If abuse is detected, the owner of the Author domain can
		    remove the key from publication in the DNS as a way of
		    revoking that key and thus invalidating any unverified
		    DKIM-Delegate fields. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="disc" title="Discussion">
		<t> The use of the Primary signature ensures that if the
		    original message arrives unmodified, the Receiver is
		    assured of its legitimacy as having been generated and
		    sent by the original signer, irrespective of what
		    Mediator handled it. </t>

		<t> Mediators, such as mailing list software, commonly make
		    adjustments to a message prior to re-submitting it for
		    transfer to final recipients.  Adjustments often include
		    prepending list-identifying material to the Subject
		    field, or appending URIs and such to the message body
		    referring Receivers to further information about the list
		    itself.  This will almost always invalidate the Primary
		    signature, so downstream receivers cannot be sure
		    (via DKIM, at least) where the message originated. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
		<t> Use of this header field (and DKIM as described here)
		    amounts to an ephemeral granting of the ability for the
		    first Receivers (typically the Mediators named in the To
		    and Cc fields) to generate content that the ultimate
		    Receivers will consider valid on behalf of the Author.  A
		    compromised Mediator can thus replace the original content
		    in its entirety while still satisfying this protocol. </t>

		<t> The "t=" tag might be used to name Mediators that
		    do not appear in the To or Cc fields of a message, which
		    means they would normally appear in the message envelope
		    only.  Thus, use of that tag records envelope details in
		    the message, which could be information intended to be kept
		    private. </t>

		<t> As described in <xref target="mech"/>, this mechanism
		    signature presents a time-limited but nevertheless present
		    opportunity for someone at the Mediator's domain to
		    generate content apparently authorized by the Author
		    domain. </t>

		<t> Given the exposures described above, message originators
		    would do well to consider limiting use of this protocol to
		    those messages that will transit trusted Mediators only.
		    Determining which Mediators are worthy of such trust is
		    a local policy matter, outside of the scope of this
		    document. </t>

		<t> Given the following message header (numbers in braces
		    are line numbers):
			<figure><artwork>
    {1}  From: somebody@example.com
    {2}  To: mailinglist@ietf.example
    {3}  Subject: What's up with DKIM?
    {4}  Date: Thu, 12 Jun 2014 11:08:10 -0700
    {5}  DKIM-Signature: v=1; s=rashani; d=example.com;

    {9}
    {10} [message body omitted]
			</artwork></figure> </t>

		<t> The DKIM signature (line 5) is an Author
		    signature that covers the entire message body (the
		    "Primary" signature).  If it validates on delivery, the
		    remainder of the DKIM material can be ignored. </t>

		<t> There is also a DKIM-Delegate header field (line 7) that
		    identifies the delegating party in its "d=" tag.  It
		    states that signing authority is delegated by
		    "example.com" to "ietf.example" (the Mediator domain).
		    The integrity of this field is assured by the fact that
		    its signature verified. </t>

		<t> On receipt at the Mediator, both signatures will typically
		    validate.  The Mediator then augments the content as needed
		    and re-sends the message for delivery, this time adding its
		    own signature:
			<figure><artwork>
    {1}  From: somebody@example.com
    {2}  To: mailinglist@ietf.example
    {3}  Subject: What's up with DKIM?
    {4}  Date: Thu, 12 Jun 2014 11:08:10 -0700

    {12}
    {13} [augmented message body omitted]
			</artwork></figure></t>

		<t> Because of the changed content, the Primary signature no
		    longer validates.  However, the Mediator signature will
		    presumably validate on receipt, since it covers all of
		    the modified content.  In addition, the DKIM-Delegate
		    field would be expected to validate as it is unlikely to
		    be altered by Mediators. </t>

		<t> The Receiver of this message (a list subscriber, in this
		    case) can conclude that the following are true, based on
		    the remaining valid signatures:
			<list style="numbers">
				<t> "example.com" authorized "ietf.example"
				    to sign mail on its behalf; </t>

				<t> "ietf.example" signed the altered content,
				    thus taking some responsibility for
				    it; </t>

				<t> This chain of handling satisfies the need
				    for the Author domain to have signed the
				    message; the original message may have been
				    modified or replaced, but such action was
				    explicitly approved by the Author
				    domain. </t>
