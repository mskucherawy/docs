	<abstract>
		<t> <xref target="RFC7001"/> describes a header field called
		    Authentication-Results for use with
		    electronic mail messages to indicate the results of
		    message authentication efforts.  Any receiver-side
		    software, mainly Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) or mail
		    filters, can add or use this header field to relay that
		    information in a convenient and meaningful way to
		    later-stage systems, such as for sorting and filtering
		    decisions. </t>

		<t> One portion of the definition in that document limits
		    the types of authentication properties about a message
		    to a small, fixed set.  This document updates the
		    specification, making it extensible to allow new property
		    types to be declared and used. </t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> <xref target="RFC7001"/> defines the email
		    Authentication-Results header field that
		    presents the results of an authentication effort
		    in a machine-readable format.  The header field
		    creates a place to collect the output from authentication
		    processes that are disjoint from later processes that
		    might use the output, such as analysis, filtering or
		    sorting mechanisms.  </t>

		<t> The specification in that document enumerated a small set
		    of types of properties that can be reported using this
		    mechanism.  There has emerged a desire to report
		    types of properties about a message through this mechanism.
		    Accordingly, this document updates the specification
		    to allow for additional property types ("ptypes") beyond
		    the original set, and creates a registry where new ones
		    can be listed and their defining documents referenced. </t>

	<section anchor="definition" title="Updated 'ptype' Definition">
		<t> Advanced Backus Naur Form (ABNF) is defined in 
		    <xref target="RFC5234"/>. </t>

		<t> The ABNF in Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC7001"/> is
		    updated as follows:

		    <figure><artwork>
    ptype = Keyword
          ; indicates whether the property being evaluated was
          ; a parameter to an [SMTP] command, was a value taken
          ; from a message header field, was some property of
          ; the message body, or was some other property evaluated by
          ; the receiving MTA
		    </artwork></figure></t>

		<t> The ABNF token "Keyword" is defined in Section 4.1.2 of
		    <xref target="RFC5321"/>. </t>

		<t> Legal values of "ptype" are as defined 
		    in the IANA "Email Authentication Property Types"
		    registry (see <xref target="iana"/>).  The initial values
		    are as follows, matching those defined in
		    <xref target="RFC7001"/>:

		    <list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="body:"> Indicates information that was
				extracted from the body of the message.  This
				might be an arbitrary string of bytes, a hash
				of a string of bytes, a Uniform Resource
				Identifier, or some other content of
				interest. </t>

			<t hangText="header:"> Indicates information that was
				extracted from the header of the message.  This
				might be the value of a header field or some
				portion of a header field. </t>

			<t hangText="policy:"> As defined in Section 2.3 of
				<xref target="RFC7001"/>. </t>

			<t hangText="smtp:"> Indicates information that was
				extracted from an SMTP command that was used
				to relay the message. </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> A consumer of this header field encountering a "ptype"
		    it does not understand MUST ignore the result it is
		    reporting. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
		<t> IANA is requested to create the Email Authentication
		    Property Types registry.  Entries in this registry
		    are subject to the Expert Review rules as 
		    described in <xref target="RFC5226"/>.  Each entry in
		    the registry requires the following values:

		    <list style="symbols">
			<t> The "ptype" token to be registered, which must
			    fit within the ABNF described in
			    <xref target="definition"/>. </t>

			<t> A brief description of what sort of information
			    this "ptype" is meant to cover. </t>

			<t> A reference to the defining document, if any. </t>
		    </list> </t>
	
		<t> The initial entries in this table are enumerated in
		    <xref target="definition"/>.  This document should be
		    listed as their defining document values. </t>

		<t> For new entries, the Designated Expert needs to
		    assure that the description provided for the new entry
		    adequately describes the intended use.  An example
		    would be helpful to include, although entries in the
		    Email Authentication Methods registry or the Email
		    Authentication Result Names registry might also serve
		    as examples of intended use. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
		<t> A consumer of this header field might be confused
		    by a result bearing a "ptype" it does not understand.
		    The advice is to ignore such a result since
		    its semantics are unknown to such a consumer.
		    It is unknown how legacy code, which expects one of a
		    fixed set of "ptype" tokens, will handle new tokens
		    as they begin to appear.  This might result
		    in undesirable deliveries for consumers that have been
		    implemented to "fail open". </t>
