Various Internet protocols and applications require some mechanism for
determining whether two Domain Name System (DNS) names are related.  A
popular example is the need to determine whether example.com and
foo.example.com are subject to the same administrative authority.  To
humans, the answer to this may be obvious.  However, the DNS does not
currently provide the ability to mark these sorts of relationships, which
makes them impossible to discern with simple programming.  For example,
the right answer is not always "compare the rightmost two labels".

The particular issue is that there is policy structure imposed by
organizations and by the domain name registration system that is independent
of the architecture and protocol upon which the DNS is built.  Historically,
solutions for identifying relationships between domain names have been based
almost exclusively on the DNS namespace and protocol.  While this basis is
often sufficient, the fact that it relies on assumptions stemming from the
nature of the DNS makes such solutions unreliable and unnecessarily
constrained.  For example, confirming or dismissing a relationship between
two domain names based on the existence of a zone cut or common ancestry is
often unfounded.

For the purposes of this work, domain names are approached as identifiers
used in other services, and not as DNS names in themselves.  The working group
is not chartered to do any work on management of the DNS itself.  The
structure of the DNS and the administrative boundaries in the DNS are
entirely out of scope for the working group.

Currently, the most well known solution in existence is the Public Suffix
List (PSL).  The PSL is maintained by a Web browser producer and is kept
current by volunteers on a best-effort basis.  It contains a list of points
in the DNS tree at which registrations take place and is used to identify
the boundary between so-called "public" names (below which registrations
can occur) and the private names (i.e., registered names) below them.
When this list is inaccurate, it exposes a deviation from reality that
degrades service to some and can be exploited by others.  Being the de
facto resource, and lacking a more comprehensive, alternative solution for
relationship identification, the functionality of the PSL has often been
misused to accomplish means beyond its capabilities.  For example, there
is no way to confirm the relationship between two domain names, only
signal that there is or is not a public boundary between the two.
Additionally, there are questions about the scalability, central management,
and third-party management of the PSL as it currently exists.

In terms of specific use cases: Within the realm of email, there is a
desire to link an arbitrary fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) to the
organizational domain name (traditionally in the namespace above it),
in order to identify a deterministic location where some sort of statement
of policy regarding that domain name can be found.  With respect to the
web, there is a similar need to identify relationships between different
FQDNs, currently accomplished by comparing ancestries.  However, there
is also desire to reliably identify relationships outside of the realm
and constraints of the DNS namespace tree.

Previous work such as Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP; RFC5617), and
current work such as DMARC (draft-kucherawy-dmarc-base), would certainly
benefit from having this capability.

The DBOUND working group will develop one or more solutions to this family
of problems.  If possible, a unified solution will be developed.  However,
the working group may discover that the email, web, equivalence, and
possibly other problems require independent solutions, in which case the
working group will follow that path.  The solutions may or may not involve
changes to the DNS, such as creation of new resource record types; in any
case, all such changes will be incremental only.

This working group will not seek to amend the consuming protocols themselves
(i.e., any web or mail standards) without rechartering, and only after
completion of the base work.  Any such work undertaken in parallel will
eeed to be done as individual or independent submissions, or in another
working group.
