Various Internet protocols and applications require some mechanism for
determining whether two identifiers based on Domain Name System (DNS) names
are related.  A popular example is the need to determine whether example.com
and foo.example.com are related; although to humans the answer to this may be
obvious, it is difficult to establish this programmatically since the right
answer is not always "compare the rightmost two labels".

The particular issue is that there is structure imposed by users and by the
domain name registration system that is independent of the architecture and
protocol upon which the DNS is built.  Stated more generally, given two
domain names, the temptation thus far has been to seek a solution that
emphasizes the nature and design of the DNS protocol.  This needs to be
resisted; instead, a solution is needed that emphasizes the needs of the
applications using the names, not merely what the DNS can offer.

Currently, the only solution in existence is maintained by a web browser
producer, known as the Public Suffix List.  This list, which is kept current
by volunteers on a best-effort basis, contains a list of points in the DNS
tree at which registrations take place.  When this list is inaccurate, it
exposes a deviation with reality that degrades service to some and can be
exploited by others.  It amounts to a third set of semantics imposed upon
the DNS from without, creating unrealistic expectations and eventually
solving the wrong problem.

In terms of specific use cases: Within the realm of email, there is a
desire to map an arbitrary domain name to the registered domain name
somewhere in the tree, in order to identify a deterministic
location where some sort of statement of policy regarding that domain
name can be found.  With respect to the web, there is a similar practice
of identifying domains as related as long as they share a common ancestor
under the same management.  However, there is an additional desire for the
capability to declare relationships between arbitrary names irrespective of
their relative locations in the DNS tree.

Previous work such as Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP; RFC5617), and
current work such as DMARC (draft-kucherawy-dmarc-base), would certainly
benefit from having this capability.

The DBOUND working group will develop one or more solutions to this family
of problems.  If possible, a unified solution will be developed.  However,
the working group may discover that the email, web, and equivalence problems
require independent solutions, in which case the working group will follow
that path.  The solutions may or may not involve changes to the DNS, such
as creation of new resource record types; in any case, all such changes
will be incremental only.

This working group will not seek to amend the consuming protocols themselves
(i.e., any web or mail standards) without rechartering, and only after
completion of the base work.  Any such work undertaken in parallel will
need to be done as individual or independent submissions, or in another
working group.
