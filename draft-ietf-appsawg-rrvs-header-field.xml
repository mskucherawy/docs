	<abstract>
		<t> This document defines an email header field,
		    Require-Recipient-Valid-Since, to provide a method for
		    senders to indicate to receivers the time when the sender
		    last confirmed the ownership of the target mailbox.
		    This can be used to detect changes of mailbox ownership,
		    and thus prevent mail from being delivered to the wrong
		    party. </t>

		<t> The intended use of this header field is on automatically
		    generated messages that might contain sensitive
		    information. </t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> Email addresses sometimes get reassigned to a different
		    person.  For example, employment changes at a company can
		    cause an address used for an ex-employee to be assigned to
		    a new employee, or a mail service provider (MSP) might
		    expire an account and then let someone else register for
		    the local-part that was previously used.  Those who sent
		    mail to the previous owner of an address might not know
		    that it has been reassigned.  This can lead to the sending
		    of email to the correct address, but the wrong
		    recipient. </t>

		<t> What is needed is a way to indicate an attribute of the
		    recipient that will distinguish between the previous owner
		    of an address and its current owner, if they are different.
		    Further, this needs to be done in a way that respects
		    privacy. </t>

		<t> The mechanism specified here allows the sender of the mail
		    to indicate how "old" the address assignment is expected
		    to be.  In effect, the sender is saying, "The person to
		    whom I am sending to had this address assigned to as far
		    back as this date-time."  A receiving system can then
		    compare this information against the date and time the
		    address was assigned to its current user.  If the
		    assignment was made later than the date-time indicated in
		    the message, there is a good chance the current user of
		    the address is not the correct recipient.  The receiving
		    system can then choose to prevent delivery and, possibly,
		    to notify the original sender of the problem. </t>

		<t> The primary application is automatically generated messages
		    rather than user-authored content.  </t>

		    <xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/>. </t>

		<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
		    "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
		    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
		    interpreted as described in <xref target="KEYWORDS"/>. </t>
	</section>

	<section title="Description" anchor="descr">
		<t> The Require-Recipient-Valid-Since header field includes
		    an intended recipient coupled with a timestamp indicating
		    the most recent date and time when the message author
		    believed the destination mailbox to be under the continuous
		    ownership (see <xref target="own"/>) of a specific party.
		    Presumably there has been some confirmation process applied
		    to establish this ownership; however, the method of making
		    such determinations is a local matter and outside the scope
		    of this document. </t>

		<t> The general constraints on syntax and placement
		    of header fields in a message are defined in
		    Internet Message Format <xref target="MAIL"/>. </t>

		<t> Using Augmented Backus-Naur Form <xref target="ABNF"/>,
		    the syntax for the field is:

		    <figure><artwork>
    rrvs = "Require-Recipient-Valid-Since:" addr-spec; date-time CRLF
		    </artwork></figure> </t>

		<t> "CFWS" is defined in Section 3.2.2, "date-time" is
		    defined in Section 3.3, and "addr-spec" is defined in
		    Section 3.4.1, of <xref target="MAIL"/>. </t>

		<t> A receiving system that implements this specification
		    checks whether the current mailbox owner has held it
		    continuously, far enough back to include the given
		    date-time, and delivers it unless that check returns
		    in the negative.  Expressed as a sequence of steps:

		    <list style="numbers">
			<t> Extract the set of Require-Recipient-Valid-Since
			    fields from the message. </t>

			<t> Discard any such fields that are syntactically
			    invalid. </t>

			<t> Discard any such fields that name a role account as
			    listed in Mailbox Names For Common Services, Roles
			    And Functions <xref target="ROLES"/>. </t>

			<t> Discard any such fields for which the "addr-spec"
			    portion does not match a current recipient, as
			    listed in the RCPT TO commands in the
			    corresponding Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
			    <xref target="SMTP"/> session. </t>

			<t> For each field remaining, determine if the named
			    address has been under continuous ownership since
			    the corresponding timestamp.  If it has not,
			    reject the message. </t>

			<t> RECOMMENDED: If local delivery is being performed,
			    remove all instances of this field prior to
			    delivery to a mailbox; if the message is being
			    forwarded, remove those instances of this header
			    field that were not discarded by steps 1-4
			    above. </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> The final step is not mandatory as not all mail handling
		    agents are capable of stripping away header fields. </t>

		<t> If a message is to be rejected within the SMTP protocol
		    itself (versus generating a rejection message separately),
		    servers implementing this protocol and the SMTP extensions
		    described in Enhanced Mail System Status Codes
		    <xref target="ESC"/> SHOULD use the enhanced status code
		    described in <xref target="iana_esc"/>. </t>

		<t> Implementation is expected to be transparent to non
		    participants, since they would typically ignore this header
		    field. </t>

		<t> This header field is not typically added to a message that
		    is addressed to multiple recipients.  The intended use of
		    this field involves an author seeking to protect
		    transactional or otherwise sensitive data intended for a
		    single recipient, and thus generating independent messages
		    for each individual recipient is normal practice.
		    Because of the nature of SMTP, a message bearing this
		    header field for multiple addressees could result in a
		    single delivery attempt for multiple recipients (in
		    particular, if two of the recipients are handled by the
		    same server), and if any one of them fails the test, the
		    delivery fails to all of them; it then becomes necessary
		    to generate a Delivery Status Notification
		    <xref target="DSN"/> message for each of the failed
		    recipients indicating the specific failure cause for
		    each. </t>

		<t> To further obscure account details on the receiving system,
		    the receiver SHOULD ignore the header field if the address
		    within it has had one continuous owner since it was
		    created, regardless of the purported confirmation date of
		    the address.  This is further discussed in
		    <xref target="security"/>. </t>
	</section>

	<section title="Use with Mailing Lists" anchor="lists">
		<t> Mailing list services can store the timestamp at which
		    a subscriber was added to a mailing list.  This
		    specification can be used in conjunction with that
		    information in order to restrict traffic to the original
		    subscriber, rather than a different person now in
		    possession of an address under which the original
		    subscriber registered.  Upon receiving a rejection caused
		    by this specification, the list service can remove that
		    address from further distribution. </t>

		<t> A mailing list service that receives a message containing
		    this field removes it from the message prior to
		    redistributing it, limiting exposure of information
		    regarding the relationship between the message's author
		    and mailing list. </t>
	</section>

	<section title="Discussion" anchor="disc">
		<t> It can be argued that placing this information in a message
		    header field is not the ideal architectural choice and
		    that it would have been better to introduce this
		    capability as an extension to SMTP.  The exchange of meta
		    data about the target address is not part of the actual
		    message content, nor is it meta data about the content.
		    However, if the author and the target address are
		    separated by an SMTP server that does not implement the
		    SMTP extension, the check will not be able to propagate
		    to the intended receiving system.  Implementing this
		    service as a header field allows the check to occur
		    even across non-participating systems, effectively
		    tunneling the request. </t>

		<t> The presence of the intended address in the field content
		    supports the case where a message bearing this header field
		    is forwarded.  The specific use case is as follows:
			<list style="numbers">
				<t> A user subscribes to a service "S" on
				    date "D" and confirms an email address at
				    the user's current location, "A"; </t>

				<t> At some later date, the user intends to
				    leave the current location, and thus
				    creates a new mailbox elsewhere, at
				    "B"; </t>

				<t> The user replaces address "A" with
				    forwarding to "B"; </t>

				<t> "S" constructs a message to "A" claiming
				    that address was valid at date "D" and
				    sends it to "A"; </t>

				<t> The receiving MTA at "A" determines that
				    the forwarding in effect was created by the
				    same party that owned the mailbox there,
				    and thus concludes the continuous ownership
				    test has been satisfied; </t>

				<t> If possible, "A" removes this header field
				    from the message, and in either case,
				    forwards it to "B"; </t>

				<t> On receipt at "B", either the header field
				    has been removed, or the header field does
				    not refer to a current envelope recipient,
				    and in either case delivers the
				    message. </t>
			</list> </t>

		<t> Some services generate messages with an RFC5322.To field
		    that does not contain a valid address, in order to obscure
		    the intended recipient.  For this reason, the original
		    intended recipient is included in this header field. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="own" title="Continuous Ownership">
		<t> Determining continuous ownership of a mailbox is a local
		    matter at the receiving site.  In particular, the only
		    possible answers to the continuous-ownership-since
		    question are "yes", "no", and "unknown"; the action to
		    be taken in the "unknown" case is a matter of local
		    policy. </t>

		<t> For example, when control of a domain name is
		    transferred, the new domain owner might be unable to
		    determine whether the owner of the subject address has
		    been under continuous ownership since the stated date if
		    the mailbox history is not also transferred (or was not
		    previously maintained). </t>

		<t> It will also be "unknown" if whatever database
		    contains mailbox ownership data is temporarily unavailable
		    at the time a message arrives for delivery.  In this case,
		    typical SMTP temporary failure handling is
		    appropriate. </t>

	<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
	    <section anchor="sec_flares" title="Abuse Countermeasures">
		<t> The response of a server implementing this protocol
		    can disclose information about the age of existing
		    email mailbox.  Implementation of countermeasures against
		    probing attacks is advised.  For example, an operator
		    could track appearance of this field with respect to a
		    particular mailbox and observe the timestamps being
		    submitted for testing; if it appears a variety of
		    timestamps is being tried against a single mailbox in short
		    order, the field could be ignored and the message silently
		    discarded.  This concern is discussed further in
		    <xref target="privacy"/>. </t>
	    </section>

	    <section anchor="sec_restrict" title="Suggested Use Restrictions">
		<t> If the mailbox named in the field
		    is known to have had only a single continuous owner
		    since creation, or not to have existed at all (under any
		    owner) prior to the date specified in the field, then the
		    field can be silently ignored and normal message handling
		    applied so that this information is not disclosed.  Such
		    fields are likely the product of either gross error or an
		    attack. </t>

		<t> A message author using this specification might restrict
		    inclusion of the header field such that it is only done
		    for recipients known also to implement this specification,
		    in order to reduce the possibility of revealing information
		    about the relationship between the author and the
		    mailbox. </t>
	    </section>
	</section>

	<section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
	    <section anchor="priv_probing" title="Probing Attacks">
		<t> As described above, use of this header field in probing
		    attacks can disclose information about the history
		    of the mailbox.  The harm that can be done by leaking any
		    kind of private information is difficult to predict,
		    so it is prudent to be sensitive to this
		    sort of disclosure, either inadvertently or in response
		    to probing by an attacker.  It bears restating, then, that
		    implementing countermeasures to abuse of this capability
		    needs strong consideration. </t>

		<t> That some MSPs allow for expiration of account names when
		    they have been unused for a protracted period forces a
		    choice between two potential types of privacy
		    vulnerabilities, one of which presents significantly
		    greater threats to users than the other.  Automatically
		    generated mail is often used to convey authentication
		    credentials that can potentially provide access to
		    extremely sensitive information.  Supplying such
		    credentials to the wrong party after a mailbox ownership
		    change could allow the previous owner's data to be
		    exposed without his or her authorization or knowledge.
		    In contrast, the information that may be exposed to a
		    third party via the proposal in this document is limited
		    to information about the mailbox history.  Given that
		    MSPs have chosen to allow transfers of mailbox ownership
		    without the prior owner's involvement, the information
		    leakage from the header field specified here creates far
		    fewer risks than the potential for delivering mail to the
		    wrong party. </t>
	    </section>

	    <section anchor="priv_envelope" title="Envelope Recipients">
		<t> The email To and Cc header fields are not required to be
		    populated with addresses that match the envelope recipient
		    set, and Cc may even be absent.  However, the algorithm in
		    <xref target="descr"/> requires that this header field
		    contain a match for an envelope recipient in order to be
		    actionable.  As such, use of this specification can
		    reveal some or all of the original intended recipient
		    set to any party that can see the message in transit or
		    upon delivery. </t>

		<t> For a message destined to a single recipient, this is
		    unlikely to be a concern, which is one of the reasons
		    use of this specification on multi-recipient messages is
