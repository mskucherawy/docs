	<abstract>
		<t> This document defines an extension for the Simple Mail
		    Transfer Protocol called RRVS, and a header field called
		    Require-Recipient-Valid-Since, to provide a method for
		    senders to indicate to receivers the time when the sender
		    last confirmed the ownership of the target mailbox.
		    This can be used to detect changes of mailbox ownership,
		    and thus prevent mail from being delivered to the wrong
		    party. </t>

		<t> The intended use of these facilities is on automatically
		    generated messages that might contain sensitive
		    information, though it may also be useful in other
		    applications. </t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> Email addresses sometimes get reassigned to a different
		    person.  For example, employment changes at a company can
		    cause an address used for an ex-employee to be assigned to
		    a new employee, or a mail service provider (MSP) might
		    expire an account and then let someone else register for
		    the local-part that was previously used.  Those who sent
		    mail to the previous owner of an address might not know
		    that it has been reassigned.  This can lead to the sending
		    of email to the correct address, but the wrong
		    recipient. </t>

		<t> What is needed is a way to indicate an attribute of the
		    recipient that will distinguish between the previous owner
		    of an address and its current owner, if they are different.
		    Further, this needs to be done in a way that respects
		    privacy. </t>

		<t> The mechanisms specified here allow the sender of the mail
		    to indicate how "old" the address assignment is expected
		    to be.  In effect, the sender is saying, "The person to
		    whom I am sending to had this address assigned to as far
		    back as this date-time."  A receiving system can then
		    compare this information against the date and time the
		    address was assigned to its current user.  If the
		    assignment was made later than the date-time indicated in
		    the message, there is a good chance the current user of
		    the address is not the correct recipient.  The receiving
		    system can then choose to prevent delivery and, possibly,
		    to notify the original sender of the problem. </t>

		<t> The primary application is automatically generated messages
		    rather than user-authored content, though it may be useful
		    in other contexts.  </t>

		    <xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/>. </t>

		<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",

	</section>

	<section title="Description" anchor="descr">
		<t> To address the problem described above, a mail sending
		    client needs to indicate to the server to which it is
		    connecting that there is an expectation that the
		    destination of the message has been under continuous
		    ownership since some date-time, presumably the most recent
		    time the message author had confirmed its understanding
		    of who owned that mailbox.  Two mechanisms are defined
		    here: an extension to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
		    <xref target="SMTP"/>, for use between a client and
		    server that both implement the extension, and a header
		    field that can be used when passing a message to a server
		    that appears not to implement this extension. </t>

		<t> The SMTP extenion is called "RRVS" (Require Recipient
		    Valid Since), and adds a parameter to the SMTP "RCPT"
		    command that indicates the most recent date and time when
		    the message author believed the destination mailbox to be
		    under the continuous ownership (see <xref target="own"/>)
		    of a specific party.  Similarly, the
		    Require-Recipient-Valid-Since header field includes
		    an intended recipient coupled with a timestamp indicating
		    the same thing.
		    Presumably there has been some confirmation process applied
		    to establish this ownership; however, the method of making
		    such determinations is a local matter and outside the scope
		    of this document. </t>

		<section anchor="descr_esmtp"
		         title="The 'RRVS' SMTP Extension">
			<t> Extensions to SMTP are described in Section 2.2 of 
			    <xref target="SMTP"/>. </t>

			<t> The name of the extension is "RRVS", an
			    abbreviation of "Require Recipient Valid Since".
			    Servers implementing the SMTP extension advertise
			    an additional EHLO keyword of "RRVS", which has
			    no associated parameters, introduces no new
			    SMTP verbs, and does not alter the MAIL verb. </t>

			<t> An MTA implementing RRVS can transmit or accept a
			    new parameter to the RCPT command.  The new
			    parameter is "RRVS", which takes a value
			    that is a timestamp expressed as a
			    "date-time" as defiend in
			    <xref target="DATETIME"/>, with the added
			    restriction that a "time-secfrac" MUST NOT
			    be used.  Accordingly, this extension increases
			    the maximum command length for the RCPT verb by
			    31 characters. </t>

			<t> The meaning of this extension, when used, is
			    described in <xref target="op_esmtp"/>. </t>

		<section anchor="descr_header"
		         title="The 'Require-Recipient-Valid-Since' Header Field">
			<t> The general constraints on syntax and placement of
			    header fields in a message are defined in Internet
			    Message Format <xref target="MAIL"/>. </t>

			<t> Using Augmented Backus-Naur Form
			    <xref target="ABNF"/>, the syntax for the field is:

		    	<figure><artwork>
    rrvs = "Require-Recipient-Valid-Since:" addr-spec; date-time CRLF
		    	</artwork></figure> </t>

			<t> "CFWS" is defined in Section 3.2.2, "date-time"
			    is defined in Section 3.3, and "addr-spec" is
			    defined in Section 3.4.1, of

	<section anchor="op" title="Handling By Receivers">
		<t> If a receiver implements the RRVS SMTP extension, then
		    there are two possible evaluation paths:

		    <list style="numbers">
			<t> The sending client implements the extension, and
			    so there was an RRVS parameter on a RCPT TO
			    command in the SMTP session; or </t>

			<t> The sending client does not (or elected not to)
			    implement the extension, so the RRVS parameter
			    was not present on the RCPT TO commands in the SMTP
			    session. </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<section anchor="op_esmtp" title="SMTP Extension Used">
			<t> A receiving system that implements the SMTP
			    extension declared above and observes an RRVS
			    parameter on a RCPT TO command checks whether the
			    current owner of the destination mailbox has held
			    it continuously, far enough back to inclue the
			    given date-time, and delivers it unless that check
			    returns in the negative.  Expressed as a sequence
			    of steps:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> Ignore the parameter if the named mailbox
				    is a role account as listed in
			            Mailbox Names For Common Services, Roles
			            And Functions <xref target="ROLES"/>. 
				    (See <xref target="roles"/>.) </t>

				<t> Determine if the named address is serviced
				    for local delivery.  If so, and if that
				    address, has not been under continuous
				    ownership since the specified timestamp,
				    return a 550 error to the RCPT command.
				    (See also <xref target="iana_esc"/>.) </t>

				<t> RECOMMENDED: If any
				    Require-Recipient-Valid-Since header
				    fields are present and refer to the named
				    address, remove them prior to delivery
				    or relaying.  (See
				    <xref target="op_header"/> for
				    discussion.) </t>
			    </list> </t>

			<section anchor="op_relay" title="Relays">
				<t> An MTA that does not make mailbox
				    ownership checks, such as an MTA
				    positioned to do SMTP ingress at an
				    organizational boundary, SHOULD relay the
				    RRVS extension parameter to the next MTA
				    so that it can be processed there. </t>

				<t> An MTA could replace the envelope as a
				    result of simple alias expansion, mapping
				    one mailbox to several other mailboxes.
				    In this case, each of the new SMTP
				    recipients SHOULD NOT include RRVS
				    RRVS parameter when relaying to the new
				    addresses. </t>
			</section>
		</section>
		
		<section anchor="op_header" title="Header Field Used">
			<t> A receiving system that implements this
			    specification, upon receiving a message bearing a
			    Require-Recipient-Valid-Since header field when no
			    corresponding RRVS SMTP extension was used, checks
			    whether the destination mailbox owner has held it
			    continuously, far enough back to include the
			    given date-time, and delivers it unless that check
			    returns in the negative.  Expressed as a sequence
			    of steps:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> Extract the set of
				    Require-Recipient-Valid-Since fields from
				    the message for which no corresponding
				    RRVS SMTP extension was used. </t>

				<t> Discard any such fields that are
				    syntactically invalid. </t>

				<t> Discard any such fields that name a role
				    account as listed in
				    <xref target="ROLES"/> (see
				    <xref target="roles"/>). </t>

				<t> Discard any such fields for which the
				    "addr-spec" portion does not match a
				    current recipient, as listed in the
				    RCPT TO commands in the SMTP session. </t>

				<t> Discard any such fields for which the
				    "addr-spec" portion does not refer to a
				    mailbox handled for local delivery by
				    this MTA. </t>

				<t> For each field remaining, determine if
				    the named address has been under
				    continuous ownership since the
				    corresponding timestamp.  If it has not,
				    reject the message. </t>

				<t> RECOMMENDED: If local delivery is being
				    performed, remove all instances of this
				    field prior to delivery to a mailbox; if
				    the message is being forwarded, remove
				    those instances of this header field that
				    were not discarded by steps 1-4 above. </t>
		    	</list> </t>

			<t> Handling proceeds normally upon completion of the
			    above steps if rejection has not been
			    performed. </t>

			<t> The final step is not mandatory as not all mail
			    handling agents are capable of stripping away
			    header fields, and there are sometimes reasons to
			    keep the field intact such as debugging or
			    presence of digital signatures that might be
			    invalidated by such a change. </t>

			<t> If a message is to be rejected within the SMTP
			    protocol itself (versus generating a rejection
			    message separately), servers implementing this
			    protocol SHOULD also implement the SMTP extension
			    described in Enhanced Mail System Status Codes
			    <xref target="ESC"/> and use the enhanced
			    status codes described in
			    <xref target="iana_esc"/> as appropriate. </t>

			<t> Implementation by this method is expected to
			    be transparent to non-participants, since they
			    would typically ignore this header field. </t>

			<t> This header field is not normally added to a
			    message that is addressed to multiple recipients.
			    The intended use of this field involves an author
			    seeking to protect transactional or otherwise
			    sensitive data intended for a single recipient,
			    and thus generating independent messages for each
			    individual recipient is normal practice.  Because
			    of the nature of SMTP, a message bearing this
			    header field for multiple addressees could result
			    in a single delivery attempt for multiple
			    recipients (in particular, if two of the
			    recipients are handled by the same server), and
			    if any one of them fails the test, the delivery
			    fails to all of them; it then becomes necessary
			    to generate a Delivery Status Notification
			    <xref target="DSN"/> message for each of
			    the failed recipients indicating the specific
			    failure cause for each. </t>

	</section>

	<section anchor="roles" title="Role Accounts">
		<t> It is necessary not to interfere with delivery of
		    messages to role mailboxes (see <xref target="ROLES"/>),
		    but it could be useful to indicate to users handling those
		    mailboxes that a change of ownership might have taken
		    place where doing so is possible. </t>
	</section>
			    
	<section anchor="tunnelling" title="Method Conversion">
		<t> Use of the SMTP extension provided here is preferable
		    over the header field method, since the additional detail
		    about the relationship between the message author and its
		    intended recipient is at best a property of the
		    message transaction and not part of the message itself.
		    The header field mechanism is defined only to enable
		    passage of the request between and through systems that
		    that do not implement the SMTP extension. </t>

		<t> If an SMTP server receives a message from a client and both
		    of them use the SMTP extension described here,
		    the server thus has "valid-since" timestamps associated
		    with one or more of the destination mailboxes.  If that
		    server needs to relay the message on to another server
		    (thereby becoming a client), but this new server does not
		    advertise the SMTP extension, the client SHOULD add
		    Require-Recipient-Valid-Since header fields matching each
		    mailbox to which relaying is being done, and the
		    corresponding valid-since timestamp for each. </t>

		<t> Similarly, if an SMTP server receives a message bearing
		    one or more Require-Recipient-Valid-Since header fields
		    for which it must now relay the message (thereby becoming
		    a client) and the new server advertises support for the
		    SMTP extension, the client SHOULD delete the header
		    field(s) and instead relay this information by making use
		    of the SMTP extension. </t>
	</section>

	<section title="Use with Mailing Lists" anchor="lists">
		<t> Mailing list services can store the timestamp at which
		    a subscriber was added to a mailing list.  This
		    specification can be used in conjunction with that
		    information in order to restrict traffic to the original
		    subscriber, rather than a different person now in
		    possession of an address under which the original
		    subscriber registered.  Upon receiving a rejection caused
		    by this specification, the list service can remove that
		    address from further distribution. </t>

		<t> A mailing list service that receives a message containing
		    this field removes it from the message prior to
		    redistributing it, limiting exposure of information
		    regarding the relationship between the message's author
		    and mailing list. </t>
	</section>

	<section title="Discussion" anchor="disc">
		<t> To further obscure account details on the receiving system,
		    the receiver SHOULD ignore the SMTP extension or the
		    header field if the address specified has had one
		    continuous owner since it was
		    created, regardless of the purported confirmation date of
		    the address.  This is further discussed in
		    <xref target="security"/>. </t>

		<t> The presence of the intended address in the field content
		    supports the case where a message bearing this header field
		    is forwarded.  The specific use case is as follows:
			<list style="numbers">
				<t> A user subscribes to a service "S" on
				    date "D" and confirms an email address at
				    the user's current location, "A"; </t>

				<t> At some later date, the user intends to
				    leave the current location, and thus
				    creates a new mailbox elsewhere, at
				    "B"; </t>

				<t> The user replaces address "A" with
				    forwarding to "B"; </t>

				<t> "S" constructs a message to "A" claiming
				    that address was valid at date "D" and
				    sends it to "A"; </t>

				<t> The receiving MTA at "A" determines that
				    the forwarding in effect was created by the
				    same party that owned the mailbox there,
				    and thus concludes the continuous ownership
				    test has been satisfied; </t>

				<t> If possible, "A" removes this header field
				    from the message, and in either case,
				    forwards it to "B"; </t>

				<t> On receipt at "B", either the header field
				    has been removed, or the header field does
				    not refer to a current envelope recipient,
				    and in either case delivers the
				    message. </t>
			</list> </t>

		<t> Some services generate messages with an RFC5322.To field
		    that does not contain a valid address, in order to obscure
		    the intended recipient.  For this reason, the original
		    intended recipient is included in this header field. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="own" title="Continuous Ownership">
		<t> Determining continuous ownership of a mailbox is a local
		    matter at the receiving site.  In particular, the only
		    possible answers to the continuous-ownership-since
		    question are "yes", "no", and "unknown"; the action to
		    be taken in the "unknown" case is a matter of local
		    policy. </t>

		<t> For example, when control of a domain name is
		    transferred, the new domain owner might be unable to
		    determine whether the owner of the subject address has
		    been under continuous ownership since the stated date if
		    the mailbox history is not also transferred (or was not
		    previously maintained). </t>

		<t> It will also be "unknown" if whatever database
		    contains mailbox ownership data is temporarily unavailable
		    at the time a message arrives for delivery.  In this case,
		    typical SMTP temporary failure handling is
		    appropriate. </t>

		<t> If the mailbox named in the field

		<t> A message author using this specification might restrict

	<section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
	    <section anchor="priv_probing" title="Probing Attacks">
		<t> As described above, use of this header field in probing

		    sort of disclosure, either inadvertently or in response

		    implementing countermeasures to abuse of this capability
		    needs strong consideration. </t>

		<t> That some MSPs allow for expiration of account names when
		    they have been unused for a protracted period forces a
		    choice between two potential types of privacy
		    vulnerabilities, one of which presents significantly
		    greater threats to users than the other.  Automatically
		    generated mail is often used to convey authentication
		    credentials that can potentially provide access to
		    extremely sensitive information.  Supplying such
		    credentials to the wrong party after a mailbox ownership
		    change could allow the previous owner's data to be
		    exposed without his or her authorization or knowledge.
		    In contrast, the information that may be exposed to a
		    third party via the proposal in this document is limited
		    to information about the mailbox history.  Given that
		    MSPs have chosen to allow transfers of mailbox ownership
		    without the prior owner's involvement, the information

		    fewer risks than the potential for delivering mail to the

		<t> The email To and Cc header fields are not required to be

		    contain a match for an envelope recipient in order to be

		    reveal some or all of the original intended recipient
		    set to any party that can see the message in transit or
