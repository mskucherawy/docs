	<abstract>
		<t> This document defines an extension for the Simple Mail
		    Transfer Protocol, called RRVS (for "Require Recipient
		    Valid Since"), to provide a method for
		    senders to indicate to receivers the time when the sender
		    last confirmed the ownership of the target mailbox.
		    This can be used to detect changes of mailbox ownership,
		    and thus prevent mail from being delivered to the wrong
		    party. </t>

		<t> The intended use of this facility is on automatically
		    generated messages that might contain sensitive
		    information, though it may also be useful in other
		    applications. </t>
	</abstract>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> Email addresses sometimes get reassigned to a different
		    person.  For example, employment changes at a company can
		    cause an address used for an ex-employee to be assigned to
		    a new employee, or a mail service provider (MSP) might
		    expire an account and then let someone else register for
		    the local-part that was previously used.  Those who sent
		    mail to the previous owner of an address might not know
		    that it has been reassigned.  This can lead to the sending
		    of email to the correct address, but the wrong
		    recipient. </t>

		<t> What is needed is a way to indicate an attribute of the
		    recipient that will distinguish between the previous owner
		    of an address and its current owner, if they are different.
		    Further, this needs to be done in a way that respects
		    privacy. </t>

		<t> The mechanism specified here allows the sender of the mail
		    to indicate how "old" the address assignment is expected
		    to be.  In effect, the sender is saying, "The person to
		    whom I am sending to had this address assigned to as far
		    back as this date-time."  A receiving system can then
		    compare this information against the date and time the
		    address was assigned to its current user.  If the
		    assignment was made later than the date-time indicated in
		    the message, there is a good chance the current user of
		    the address is not the intended recipient.  The receiving
		    system can then choose to prevent delivery and, possibly,
		    to notify the original sender of the problem. </t>

		<t> The primary application is automatically generated messages
		    rather than user-authored content, though it may be useful
		    in other contexts.  </t>

	<section title="Definitions" anchor="defs">
		<t> For a description of the email architecture, consult
		    <xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/>. </t>

		<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
		    "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
		    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
		    interpreted as described in <xref target="KEYWORDS"/>. </t>
	</section>

	<section title="Description" anchor="descr">
		<t> To address the problem described above, a mail sending
		    client needs to indicate to the server to which it is
		    connecting that there is an expectation that the
		    destination of the message has been under continuous
		    ownership since some date-time, presumably the most recent
		    time the message author had confirmed its understanding
		    of who owned that mailbox.  The mechanism defined here is
		    an extension to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
		    <xref target="SMTP"/> for use between a client and
		    server that both implement the extension. </t>

		<t> The SMTP extenion is called "RRVS" (Require Recipient
		    Valid Since), and adds a parameter to the SMTP "RCPT"
		    command that indicates the most recent date and time when
		    the message author believed the destination mailbox to be
		    under the continuous ownership (see <xref target="own"/>)
		    of a specific party.  Presumably there has been some
		    confirmation process applied to establish this ownership;
		    however, the method of making such determinations is a
		    local matter and outside the scope of this document. </t>

		<section anchor="descr_esmtp"
		         title="The 'RRVS' SMTP Extension">
			<t> Extensions to SMTP are described in Section 2.2 of 
			    <xref target="SMTP"/>. </t>

			<t> The name of the extension is "RRVS", an
			    abbreviation of "Require Recipient Valid Since".
			    Servers implementing the SMTP extension advertise
			    an additional EHLO keyword of "RRVS", which has
			    no associated parameters, introduces no new
			    SMTP verbs, and does not alter the MAIL verb. </t>

			<t> An MTA implementing RRVS can transmit or accept a
			    new parameter to the RCPT command.  The new
			    parameter is "RRVS", which takes a value
			    that is a timestamp expressed as a
			    "date-time" as defiend in
			    <xref target="DATETIME"/>, with the added
			    restriction that a "time-secfrac" MUST NOT
			    be used.  Accordingly, this extension increases
			    the maximum command length for the RCPT verb by
			    31 characters. </t>

			<t> The meaning of this extension, when used, is
			    described in <xref target="op_esmtp"/>. </t>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section anchor="op" title="Handling By Receivers">
		<t> If a receiver implements the RRVS SMTP extension, then
		    there are two possible evaluation paths:

		    <list style="numbers">
			<t> The sending client implements the extension, and
			    so there was an RRVS parameter on a RCPT TO
			    command in the SMTP session; or </t>

			<t> The sending client does not (or elected not to)
			    implement the extension, so the RRVS parameter
			    was not present on the RCPT TO commands in the SMTP
			    session. </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<section anchor="op_esmtp" title="SMTP Extension Offered">
			<t> A receiving system that implements the SMTP
			    extension declared above and observes an RRVS
			    parameter on a RCPT TO command checks whether the
			    current owner of the destination mailbox has held
			    it continuously, far enough back to inclue the
			    given date-time, and delivers it unless that check
			    returns in the negative.  Expressed as a sequence
			    of steps:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> Ignore the parameter if the named mailbox
				    is a role account as listed in
			            Mailbox Names For Common Services, Roles
			            And Functions <xref target="ROLES"/>. 
				    (See <xref target="roles"/>.) </t>

				<t> Determine if the named address is serviced
				    for local delivery.  If so, and if that
				    address has not been under continuous
				    ownership since the specified timestamp,
				    return a 550 error to the RCPT command.
				    If the server implements Enhanced Mail
				    System Status Codes <xref target="ESC"/>,
				    it SHOULD use the code defined in
				    <xref target="iana_esc"/>. </t>

				<t> Otherwise, continue with normal
				    delivery. </t>
			    </list> </t>

			<t> To further obscure account details on the
			    receiving system, the receiver SHOULD ignore the
			    SMTP extension if the address specified has had
			    one continuous owner since it was created,
			    regardless of the purported confirmation date of
			    the address.  This is further discussed in
			    <xref target="security"/>. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="op_esmtp_no"
		         title="SMTP Extension Not Offered">
			<t> For a message being sent that includes content
			    meant to be protected by this extension, the client
			    MUST NOT continue to deliver a message to a server
			    where the server does not advertise the RRVS
			    SMTP extension. </t>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section anchor="roles" title="Role Accounts">
		<t> It is necessary not to interfere with delivery of
		    messages to role mailboxes (see <xref target="ROLES"/>),
		    but it could be useful to indicate to users handling those
		    mailboxes that a change of ownership might have taken
		    place where such notification is possible. </t>
	</section>
			    
	<section title="Use with Mailing Lists" anchor="lists">
		<t> Mailing list services can store the timestamp at which
		    a subscriber was added to a mailing list.  This
		    specification can be used in conjunction with that
		    information in order to restrict traffic to the original
		    subscriber, rather than a different person now in
		    possession of an address under which the original
		    subscriber registered.  Upon receiving a rejection caused
		    by this specification, the list service can remove that
		    address from further distribution. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="own" title="Continuous Ownership">
		<t> Determining continuous ownership of a mailbox is a local
		    matter at the receiving site.  In particular, the only
		    possible answers to the continuous-ownership-since
		    question are "yes", "no", and "unknown"; the action to
		    be taken in the "unknown" case is a matter of local
		    policy. </t>

		<t> For example, when control of a domain name is
		    transferred, the new domain owner might be unable to
		    determine whether the owner of the subject address has
		    been under continuous ownership since the stated date if
		    the mailbox history is not also transferred (or was not
		    previously maintained). </t>

		<t> It will also be "unknown" if whatever database
		    contains mailbox ownership data is temporarily unavailable
		    at the time a message arrives for delivery.  In this case,
		    typical SMTP temporary failure handling is
		    appropriate. </t>
	</section>

	<section title="Examples" anchor="examples">
		<t> In the following examples, "C:" indicates data sent
		    by an SMTP client, and "S:" indicates responses by the
		    SMTP server.  Message content is CRLF terminated, though
		    these are omitted here for ease of reading. </t>

	<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
	    <section anchor="sec_flares" title="Abuse Countermeasures">
		<t> The response of a server implementing this protocol
		    can disclose information about the age of existing
		    email mailbox.  Implementation of countermeasures against
		    probing attacks is advised.  For example, an operator
		    could track appearance of this extension with respect to a
		    particular mailbox and observe the timestamps being
		    submitted for testing; if it appears a variety of
		    timestamps is being tried against a single mailbox in short
		    order, the extension could be ignored and the message
		    silently discarded.  This concern is discussed further in
		    <xref target="privacy"/>. </t>
	    </section>

	    <section anchor="sec_restrict" title="Suggested Use Restrictions">
		<t> If the mailbox named in the RCPT TO command is known to
		    have had only a single continuous owner since creation,
		    or not to have existed at all (under any owner) prior to
		    the time specified in the parameter, then the
		    field can be silently ignored and normal message handling
		    applied so that this information is not disclosed.  Such
		    parameters are likely the product of either gross error or
		    an attack. </t>

		<t> A message author using this specification might restrict
		    use of the extension such that it is only done
		    for recipients known also to implement this specification,
		    in order to reduce the possibility of revealing information
		    about the relationship between the author and the
		    mailbox. </t>

		<t> If ownership of an entire domain is transferred, the new
		    owner may not know what addresses were assigned in the past
		    by the prior owner.  Hence, no address can be known not
		    to have had a single owner, or to have existed (or not)
		    at all. </t>
	    </section>
	</section>

	<section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
	    <section anchor="priv_probing" title="Probing Attacks">
		<t> As described above, use of this extension in probing
		    attacks can disclose information about the history
		    of the mailbox.  The harm that can be done by leaking any
		    kind of private information is difficult to predict,
		    so it is prudent to be sensitive to this
		    sort of disclosure, be it inadvertently or in response
		    to probing by an attacker.  It bears restating, then, that
		    implementing countermeasures to abuse of this capability
		    needs strong consideration. </t>

		<t> That some MSPs allow for expiration of account names when
		    they have been unused for a protracted period forces a
		    choice between two potential types of privacy
		    vulnerabilities, one of which presents significantly
		    greater threats to users than the other.  Automatically
		    generated mail is often used to convey authentication
		    credentials that can potentially provide access to
		    extremely sensitive information.  Supplying such
		    credentials to the wrong party after a mailbox ownership
		    change could allow the previous owner's data to be
		    exposed without his or her authorization or knowledge.
		    In contrast, the information that may be exposed to a
		    third party via the proposal in this document is limited
		    to information about the mailbox history.  Given that
		    MSPs have chosen to allow transfers of mailbox ownership
		    without the prior owner's involvement, the information
		    leakage from the header field specified here creates far
		    fewer risks than the potential for delivering mail to the
		    wrong party. </t>
