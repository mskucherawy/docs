	<abstract>
		<t> This document defines an extension for the Simple Mail
		    Transfer Protocol called RRVS, to provide a method for
		    senders to indicate to receivers a point in time when
		    the the ownership of the target mailbox was known to the
		    sender.  This can be used to detect changes of mailbox
		    ownership, and thus prevent mail from being delivered to
		    the wrong party.  This document also defines a header field
		    called Require-Recipient-Valid-Since that can be used to
		    tunnel the request through servers that do not support
		    the extension. </t>

		<t> The intended use of these facilities is on automatically
		    generated messages, such as account statements or password
		    change instructions, that might contain sensitive
		    information, though it may also be useful in other
		    applications. </t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> Email addresses sometimes get reassigned to a different
		    person.  For example, employment changes at a company can
		    cause an address used for an ex-employee to be assigned to
		    a new employee, or a mail service provider (MSP) might
		    expire an account and then let someone else register for
		    the local-part that was previously used.  Those who sent
		    mail to the previous owner of an address might not know
		    that it has been reassigned.  This can lead to the sending
		    of email to the correct address, but the wrong
		    recipient.  This situation is of particular concern with
		    transactional mail related to purchases, online accounts,
		    and the like. </t>

		<t> What is needed is a way to indicate an attribute of the
		    recipient that will distinguish between the previous owner
		    of an address and its current owner, if they are different.
		    Further, this needs to be done in a way that respects
		    privacy. </t>

		<t> The mechanisms specified here allow the sender of the mail
		    to indicate how "old" the address assignment is expected
		    to be.  In effect, the sender is saying, "I know that
		    the intended recipient was using this address
		    at this point in time.  I don't want this message delivered
		    to anyone else"  A receiving system can then
		    compare this information against the point in time at which
		    the address was assigned to its current user.  If the
		    assignment was made later than the point in time indicated
		    in the message, there is a good chance the current user of
		    the address is not the correct recipient.  The receiving
		    system can then prevent delivery and, preferably,
		    notify the original sender of the problem. </t>

		<t> The primary application is transactional mail (such as
		    account information, password change requests, and other
		    automatically generated messages) rather than
		    user-authored content.  However, it may be useful
		    in other contexts; for example, a personal address book
		    could record the time an email address was added to it, and
		    thus use that time with this extension.  </t>

		<t> Because the use cases for this extension are strongly tied
		    to privacy issues, attention to the Security Considerations
		    (<xref target="security"/>) and the Privacy Considerations
		    (<xref target="privacy"/>), is particularly important.
		    Note, especially, the limitation described in
		    <xref target="sec_false"/>. </t>

	<section title="Definitions" anchor="defs">
		<t> For a description of the email architecture, consult
		    <xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/>. </t>

		<t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
		    "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
		    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be

	</section>

	<section title="Description" anchor="descr">
		<t> To address the problem described in <xref target="intro"/>,
		    a mail sending client (usually an automated agent) needs
		    to indicate to the server to which it is connecting that
		    it expects the destination address of the message to have
		    been under continuous ownership (see <xref target="own"/>)
		    since a specified point time.  That specified time would be
		    the time when the intended recipient gave the address to
		    the message author, or perhaps a more recent time when the
		    intended recipient reconfirmed ownership of the address
		    with the sender. </t>

		<t> Two mechanisms are defined here: an extension to the
		    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol <xref target="SMTP"/>
		    and a new message header field.  The SMTP extension
		    permits strong assurance of enforcement by confirming
		    support at each handling step for a message, and the
		    option to demand support at all nodes in the handling path
		    of the message (and returning of the message to the
		    originator otherwise).  The header field can be used when
		    the Message Delivery Agent (MDA) supports this function,
		    but an intermediary system between the sending system
		    and the MDA does not.  However, the header field
		    does not provide the same strong assurance described above, and is more prone to exposure of private information
		    (see <xref target="priv_tradeoff"/>). </t>

		<t> The SMTP extension is called "RRVS" (Require Recipient
		    Valid Since), and adds a parameter to the SMTP "RCPT"
		    command that indicates the most recent point in time when
		    the message author believed the destination mailbox to be
		    under the continuous ownership of a specific party.
		    Similarly, the Require-Recipient-Valid-Since header
		    field includes an intended recipient coupled with a
		    timestamp indicating the same thing. </t>

		<section anchor="descr_esmtp"
		         title="The 'RRVS' SMTP Extension">
			<t> Extensions to SMTP are described in Section 2.2 of 
			    <xref target="SMTP"/>. </t>

			<t> The name of the extension is "RRVS", an
			    abbreviation of "Require Recipient Valid Since".
			    Servers implementing the SMTP extension advertise
			    an additional EHLO keyword of "RRVS", which has
			    no associated parameters, introduces no new
			    SMTP commands, and does not alter the MAIL
			    command. </t>

			<t> A Message Transfer Agent (MTA) implementing RRVS
			    can transmit or accept one new parameter to the
			    RCPT command.  An MDA can also accept this new
			    parameter.  The parameter is "RRVS", and the
			    value is a timestamp expressed as a "date-time" as
			    defined in <xref target="DATETIME"/>, with the added
			    restriction that a "time-secfrac" MUST NOT be used.
			    The timestamp MAY optionally be followed by a
			    semi-colon character and a letter (known as the
			    "no-support action") indicating the action to be
			    taken when a downstream MTA is discovered that does
			    not support the extension.  Valid actions are "R"
			    (reject; the default) and "C" (continue). </t>

			<t> Formally, the new parameter and its value are
			    defined as follows:

			    <figure><artwork>
    rrvs-param = "RRVS=" date-time [ ";" ( "C" / "R" ) ]
			    </artwork></figure> </t>

			<t> Accordingly, this extension increases
			    the maximum command length for the RCPT command by
			    33 characters. </t>

			<t> The meaning of this extension, when used, is
			    described in <xref target="op_esmtp"/>. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="descr_header"
		         title="The 'Require-Recipient-Valid-Since' Header Field">
			<t> The general constraints on syntax and placement of
			    header fields in a message are defined in Internet
			    Message Format <xref target="MAIL"/>. </t>

			<t> Using Augmented Backus-Naur Form
			    <xref target="ABNF"/>, the syntax for the field is:

		    	<figure><artwork>
  rrvs = "Require-Recipient-Valid-Since:" addr-spec ";" date-time
         CRLF
		    	</artwork></figure> </t>

			<t> "date-time"
			    is defined in Section 3.3, and "addr-spec" is
			    defined in Section 3.4.1, of
			    <xref target="MAIL"/>. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="timestamps" title="Timestamps">
			<t> The header field version of this protocol has a
			    different format for the date and time expression
			    than the SMTP extension does.  This is because
			    message header fields use a format to express
			    time and date that is specific to message header
			    fields, and this is consistent with that
			    usage. </t>

			<t> Use of both date and time is done to be
			    consistent with how current implementations
			    typically store the timestamp, and to make it
			    easy to include the time zone.  In practice,
			    granularity beyond the date may or may not be
			    useful. </t>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section anchor="op_send" title="Use By Generators">
		<t> When a message is generated whose content is sufficiently
		    sensitive that an author or author's Administrative
		    Management Domain (ADMD; see <xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/>)
		    wishes to protect against misdelivery using this protocol,
		    it determines for each recipient mailbox on the message a
		    timestamp at which it last confirmed ownership of that
		    mailbox.  It then applies the SMTP extension when sending
		    the message to its destination. </t>
  
		<t> In cases where the outgoing MTA does not support the
		    extension, the header field defined above can be used to
		    pass the request through that system.  However, use of the
		    header field is only a "best-effort" approach to solving
		    the stated goals, and it has some shortcomings:

		    <list style="numbers">
			<t> The positive confirmation of support at each
			    handling node, with the option to return the
			    message to the originator when end-to-end support
			    cannot be confirmed, will be unavailable; </t>

			<t> The protocol is focused on affecting delivery
			    (that is, the transaction) rather than on content,
			    and therefore use of a header field in the content
			    is generally inappropriate; </t>

			<t> The mechanism cannot be used with multiple
			    recipients without unintentionally exposing
			    information about one recipient to the others
			    (see <xref target="multi_rcpt"/>; and </t>

			<t> There is a risk of the timestamp parameter being
			    inadvertently forwarded, automatically or
			    intentionally by the user (since user agents might
			    not reveal the presence of the header field), and
			    therefore exposed to unintended recipients. (See
			    <xref target="priv_risks"/>.) </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> Thus, the header field format MUST NOT be used unless the
		    originator or relay has specific knowledge that the
		    receiving MDA or an intermediary MTA will apply it
		    properly.  In any case, it SHOULD NOT be used for the
		    multi-recipient case. </t>

		<t> Use of the header field mechanism is further restricted by
		    the practices described in Section 7.2 of
		    <xref target="SMTP"/>, Section 3.6.3 of
		    <xref target="MAIL"/>, and <xref target="multi_rcpt"/> of
		    this document. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="op_recv" title="Handling By Receivers">
		<t> If a receiver implements this specification, then
		    there are two possible evaluation paths:

		    <list style="numbers">
			<t> The sending client uses the extension, and
			    so there was an RRVS parameter on a RCPT TO
			    command in the SMTP session and the parameters of
			    interest are taken only from there (and the
			    header field, if present, is disregarded); or </t>

			<t> The sending client does not use
			    the extension, so the RRVS parameter
			    was not present on the RCPT TO commands in the SMTP
			    session, but the corresponding header field might
			    be present in the message. </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> When the continuous ownership test fails for transient
		    reasons (such as an unavailable database or other condition
		    that is likely temporary), normal transient failure handling
		    for the message is applied. </t>

		<section anchor="op_esmtp" title="SMTP Extension Used">
			<t> For an MTA supporting the SMTP extension, the
			    requirement is to continue enforcement of
			    RRVS during the relaying process to the next MTA
			    or the MDA. </t>

			<t> A receiving MTA or MDA that implements the SMTP
			    extension declared above and observes an RRVS
			    parameter on a RCPT TO command checks whether the
			    current owner of the destination mailbox has held
			    it continuously, far enough back to include the
			    given point in time, and delivers it unless that
			    check returns in the negative.  Specifically, an
			    MDA will do the following before continuing with
			    delivery:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> Ignore the parameter if the named mailbox
				    is known to be a role account as listed in
			            Mailbox Names For Common Services, Roles
			            And Functions <xref target="ROLES"/>. </t>

				<t> If the address is not known to be a role
				    account, and if that address has not been
				    under continuous ownership since the
				    timestamp specified in the extension,
				    return a 550 error to the RCPT command.
				    (See also <xref target="iana_esc"/>.) </t>
			    </list> </t>

			<section anchor="op_relay" title="Relays">
				<t> An MTA that does not make mailbox
				    ownership checks, such as an MTA
				    positioned to do SMTP ingress at an
				    organizational boundary, SHOULD relay the
				    RRVS extension parameter to the next MTA or
				    MDA so that it can be processed there. </t>

				<t> For the SMTP extension, the optional
				    RRVS parameter defined in
				    <xref target="op_esmtp"/> indicates the
				    action to be taken when relaying a message
				    to another MTA that does not advertise
				    support for this extension.  When this is
				    the case and the no-support action was not
				    specified or is "R" (reject), the MTA
				    handling the message MUST reject the message
				    by:

				    <list style="numbers">
					<t> returning a 550 error to the
					    DATA command, if synchronous
					    service is being provided to the
					    SMTP client that introduced the
					    message; or </t>

					<t> generating a <xref target="DSN"/>
					    to indicate to the originator
					    of the message that the
					    non-delivery occurred, and
					    terminating further relay
					    attempts. </t>
				    </list> </t>

				<t> An enhanced mail system status code is
				    defined for such rejections in
				    <xref target="iana_esc"/>. </t>

				<t> See <xref target="special_single"/> for
				    additional discussion. </t>

				<t> When relaying, an MTA MUST preserve
				    the no-support action if it
				    was used by the SMTP client. </t>
			</section>
		</section>
		
		<section anchor="op_header" title="Header Field Used">
			<t> A receiving system that implements this
			    specification, upon receiving a message bearing a
			    Require-Recipient-Valid-Since header field when no
			    corresponding RRVS SMTP extension was used, checks
			    whether the destination mailbox owner has held it
			    continuously, far enough back to include the
			    given date-time, and delivers it unless that check
			    returns in the negative.  Expressed as a sequence
			    of steps:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> Extract those
				    Require-Recipient-Valid-Since fields from
				    the message that contain a recipient for
				    which no corresponding RRVS SMTP extension
				    was used. </t>

				<t> Discard any such fields that match any of
				    these criteria:
				    <list style="symbols">
					<t> are syntactically invalid; </t>
					<t> name a role account as listed in
				            <xref target="ROLES"/>; </t>
					<t> the "addr-spec" portion does not
					    match a current recipient, as
					    listed in the RCPT TO commands
					    in the SMTP session; or </t>
					<t> the "addr-spec" portion does not
					    refer to a mailbox handled for
					    local delivery by this ADMD. </t>
				    </list> </t>

				<t> For each field remaining, determine if
				    the named address has been under
				    continuous ownership since the
				    corresponding timestamp.  If it has not,
				    reject the message. </t>

				<t> RECOMMENDED: If local delivery is being
				    performed, remove all instances of this
				    field prior to delivery to a mailbox; if
				    the message is being forwarded, remove
				    those instances of this header field that
				    were not discarded by step 2 above. </t>
		    	</list> </t>

			<t> Handling proceeds normally upon completion of the
			    above steps if rejection has not been
			    performed. </t>

			<t> The final step is not mandatory as not all mail
			    handling agents are capable of stripping away
			    header fields, and there are sometimes reasons to
			    keep the field intact such as debugging or
			    presence of digital signatures that might be
			    invalidated by such a change.  See
			    <xref target="signatures"/> for additional
			    discussion. </t>

			<t> If a message is to be rejected within the SMTP
			    protocol itself (versus generating a rejection
			    message separately), servers implementing this
			    protocol SHOULD also implement the SMTP extension
			    described in Enhanced Mail System Status Codes
			    <xref target="ESC"/> and use the enhanced
			    status codes described in
			    <xref target="iana_esc"/> as appropriate. </t>

			<t> Implementation by this method is expected to
			    be transparent to non-participants, since they
			    would typically ignore this header field.  </t>

			<t> This header field is not normally added to a
			    message that is addressed to multiple recipients.
			    The intended use of this field involves an author
			    seeking to protect transactional or otherwise
			    sensitive data intended for a single recipient,
			    and thus generating independent messages for each
			    individual recipient is normal practice.  
			    See <xref target="multi_rcpt"/> for further
			    discussion and restrictions. </t>

			<section title="Design Choices" anchor="header_design">
				<t> The presence of the address in
				    the field content supports the case where
				    a message bearing this header field is
				    forwarded.  The specific use case is as
				    follows:

				    <list style="numbers">
					<t> A user subscribes to a service "S"
					    on date "D" and confirms an email
					    address at the user's current
					    location, "A"; </t>

					<t> At some later date, the user
					    intends to leave the current
					    location, and thus creates a new
					    mailbox elsewhere, at "B"; </t>

					<t> The user configures address "A" to
					    forward to "B"; </t>

					<t> "S" constructs a message to "A"
					    claiming that address was valid at
					    date "D" and sends it to "A"; </t>

					<t> The receiving MTA for "A"
					    determines that the forwarding in
					    effect was created by the same
					    party that owned the mailbox there,
					    and thus concludes the continuous
					    ownership test has been
					    satisfied; </t>

					<t> If possible, the MTA for "A" removes
					    this header field from the message,
					    and in either case, forwards it to
					    "B"; </t>

					<t> On receipt at "B", either the
					    header field has been removed, or
					    the header field does not refer to
					    a current envelope recipient,

				    </list> </t>

				<t> <xref target="special"/> discusses some
				    interesting use cases, such as the case
				    where "B" above results in further
				    forwarding of the message. </t>

				<t> SMTP has never required any correspondence
				    between addresses in the RFC5321.MailFrom
				    and RFC5321.RcptTo parameters and header
				    fields of a message, which is why the

			    in the RRVS evaluation. </t>

			<t> To minimize the risk of such incorrect results,

			    support for the SMTP extension, "B" SHOULD delete
			    the header field(s) and instead relay this
			    information by making use of the SMTP extension.
			    Note that such modification of the header might
			    affect later validation of the header upon delivery;

		<t> Additional complexity arises when a message is sent

		    that "A" and/or "B" have been redirected.  This
		    might result in either or both of the two deliveries
		    failing at "C", which is likely to confuse the message
		    author, who (as far as the author is aware) never sent
		    a message to "C" in the first place. </t>

		<t> Finally, there is an obvious concern with the fan-out

	<section title="Special Use Addresses" anchor="special">
		<t> In <xref target="DSN-SMTP"/>, an SMTP extension was
		    defined to allow SMTP clients to request generation
		    of DSNs, and related information to allow such reports
		    to be maximally useful.  Section 5.2.7 of that document
		    explored the issue of the use of that extension where
		    the recipient is a mailing list.  This extension has
		    similar concerns which are covered here following that
		    document as a model. </t>

		<t> For all cases described below, a receiving MTA SHOULD NOT
		    introduce RRVS in either form (SMTP extension or header
		    field) if the message did not arrive with RRVS
		    in use.  This would amount to second-guessing of the
		    message originator's intention and might lead to an
		    undesirable outcome. </t>

		<section title="Mailing Lists" anchor="special_lists">
			<t> Delivery to a mailing list service is considered
			    a final delivery.  Where this protocol
			    is in use, it is evaluated as per any normal
			    delivery: If the same mailing list has been
			    operating in place of the specified recipient
			    mailbox since at least the timestamp given
			    as the RRVS parameter, the message is delivered
			    to the list service normally, and is otherwise
			    not delivered. </t>

			<t> It is important, however, that the participating
			    MDA passing the message to the list service needs
			    to omit the RRVS parameter in either form (SMTP
			    extension or header field) when doing so.  The
			    emission of a message from the list service to
			    its subscribers constitutes a new message not
			    covered by the previous transaction. </t>
		</section>
		    
		<section title="Single-Recipient Aliases"
		         anchor="special_single">
			<t> Upon delivery of an RRVS-protected message to
			    an alias (acting in place of a mailbox) that
			    results in relaying of the message to a single
			    other destination, the usual RRVS check is
			    performed.  The continuous ownership test here
			    might succeed if, for example, a conventional user
			    inbox was replaced with an alias on behalf of that
			    same user, and the time when this was done
			    is recorded in a way that can be queried by the
			    relaying MTA. </t>

			<t> If the relaying system also performs some kind of
			    step where ownership of the new destination
			    address is confirmed, it SHOULD apply RRVS using
			    the later of that timestamp and the one that was
			    used inbound.  This also allows for changes to
			    the alias without disrupting the protection
			    offered by RRVS. </t>

			<t> If the relaying system has no such time records
			    related to the new destination address, the
			    RRVS SMTP extension is not used on the relaying
			    SMTP session, and the header field relative to
			    the local alias is removed, in accordance with
			    <xref target="op_recv"/>. </t>

		<section title="Multiple-Recipient Aliases"
			anchor="special_multi">
			<t> Upon delivery of an RRVS-protected message to

			    results in relaying of the message to multiple
			    other destinations, the usual RRVS check is
			    performed as in <xref target="special_single"/>.

			    is warranted.  This can reveal the existence
			    of a forwarding relationship between the original
			    intended recipient and the actual final
			    recipient. </t>

			<t> Where this is a concern, the initial delivery
			    attempt is to be treated like a mailing list
			    delivery, with RRVS evaluation done and then
			    all RRVS information removed from the message
			    prior to relaying it to its true destination. </t>

		<section title="Suggested Mailing List Enhancements"
			anchor="lists_enh">
			<t> Mailing list services could store the timestamp
			    at which a subscriber was added to a mailing list.
			    This specification could then be used in
			    conjunction with that information in order to
			    restrict list traffic to the original subscriber,
			    rather than a different person now in possession
			    of an address under which the original subscriber
			    was added to the list.  Upon receiving a rejection
			    caused by this specification, the list service can
			    remove that address from further distribution. </t>

			<t> A mailing list service that receives a message
			    containing the header field defined here needs to
			    remove it from the message prior to redistributing
			    it, limiting exposure of information regarding
			    the relationship between the message's author
			    and the mailing list. </t>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section anchor="own" title="Continuous Ownership">
		<t> For the purposes of this specification, an address is
		    defined as having been under continuous ownership since a
		    given date-time if a message sent to the address at any
		    point since the given date would not go to anyone except
		    the owner at that given date-time.  That is, while an
		    address may have been suspended or otherwise disabled
		    for some period, any mail actually delivered would have
		    been delivered exclusively to the same owner.  It is
		    presumed that some sort of relationship exists between
		    the message sender and the intended recipient.
		    Presumably there has been some confirmation process
		    applied to establish this ownership of the receiver's
		    mailbox; however, the method of making such determinations
		    is a local matter and outside the scope of this
		    document. </t>

		<t> Evaluating the notion of continuous ownership is
		    accomplished by doing any query that establishes whether
		    the above condition holds for a given mailbox. </t>

		<t> Determining continuous ownership of a mailbox is a local
		    matter at the receiving site.  The only possible answers
		    to the continuous-ownership-since question are "yes",
		    "no", and "unknown"; the action to be taken in the
		    "unknown" case is a matter of local policy. </t>

		<t> For example, when control of a domain name is
		    transferred, the new domain owner might be unable to
		    determine whether the owner of the subject address has
		    been under continuous ownership since the stated date if
		    the mailbox history is not also transferred (or was not
		    previously maintained).  It will also be "unknown" if
		    whatever database contains mailbox ownership data is
		    temporarily unavailable at the time a message arrives for
		    delivery.  In this latter case, typical SMTP temporary
		    failure handling is appropriate. </t>

		<t> To avoid exposing account details unnecessarily, if the
		    address specified has had one continuous owner since it
		    was created, any confirmation date SHOULD be considered
		    to pass the test, even if that date is earlier than the
		    account creation date.  This is further discussed in
		    <xref target="security"/>. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="signatures" title="Digital Signatures">
		<t> This protocol mandates removal of the header field
		    (when used) upon delivery in all but exceptional
		    circumstances.  If a message with the header field were
		    digitally signed in a way that included the header field,
		    altering a message in this way would invalidate the
		    signature.  However, the header field is strictly for
		    tunneling purposes and should be regarded by the rest of
		    the transport system as purely trace information. </t>

		<t> Accordingly, the header field MUST NOT be included in

		<t> The response of a server implementing this protocol
		    can disclose information about the age of an existing

		    probing attacks is RECOMMENDED.  For example, an operator
		    could track appearance of this field with respect to a
		    particular mailbox and observe the timestamps being
		    submitted for testing; if it appears a variety of
		    timestamps is being tried against a single mailbox in short
		    order, the field could be ignored and the message silently
		    discarded.  This concern is discussed further in

	    <section anchor="sec_restrict" title="Suggested Use Restrictions">
		<t> If the mailbox named in the field
		    is known to have had only a single continuous owner
		    since creation, or not to have existed at all (under any
		    owner) prior to the date specified in the field, then the
		    field SHOULD be silently ignored and normal message
		    handling applied so that this information is not
		    disclosed.  Such fields are likely the product of either
		    gross error or an attack. </t>

		<t> A message author using this specification might restrict
		    inclusion of the header field such that it is only done
		    for recipients known also to implement this specification,
		    in order to reduce the possibility of revealing information
		    about the relationship between the author and the
		    mailbox. </t>

		<t> If ownership of an entire domain is transferred, the new
		    owner may not know what addresses were assigned in the past
		    by the prior owner.  Hence, no address can be known not

	    </section>

	    <section anchor="sec_false" title="False Sense of Security">
		<t> Senders implementing this protocol likely believe their

		    considered, however, that receiving systems might not
		    implement this protocol correctly, or at all.  Furthermore,
		    use of RRVS by a sending system constitutes nothing more
		    than a request to the receiving system; that system could
		    choose not to prevent delivery for some local policy,
		    legal or operational reason, which compromises the
		    security the sending system believed was a benefit to
		    using RRVS.  This could mean the timestamp information
		    involved in the protocol becomes inadvertently
		    revealed. </t>

	    <section anchor="priv_tradeoff" title="The Trade-Off">
		<t> That some MSPs allow for expiration of account names when

		    choice between two potential types of privacy
		    vulnerabilities, one of which presents significantly
		    greater threats to users than the other.  Automatically
		    generated mail is often used to convey authentication
		    credentials that can potentially provide access to
		    extremely sensitive information.  Supplying such
		    credentials to the wrong party after a mailbox ownership
		    change could allow the previous owner's data to be
		    exposed without his or her authorization or knowledge.
		    In contrast, the information that may be exposed to a
		    third party via the proposal in this document is limited
		    to information about the mailbox history.  Given that
		    MSPs have chosen to allow transfers of mailbox ownership
		    without the prior owner's involvement, the information
		    leakage from the extensions specified here creates far
		    lower overall risk than the potential for delivering mail

	    <section anchor="priv_probing" title="Probing Attacks">

		    leaking any kind of private information is difficult to
		    predict, so it is prudent to be sensitive to this
		    sort of disclosure, either inadvertently or in response
