	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> <xref target="RFC3463"/> introduced Enhanced Mail System
		    Status Codes, and <xref target="RFC5248"/> created an IANA
		    registry for these. </t>

		<t> <xref target="RFC6376"/> and <xref target="RFC7208"/>
		    introduced, respectively, DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
		    and Sender Policy Framework (SPF), two protocols for
		    conducting message authentication.  Another common email
		    acceptance test is the reverse Domain Name System (DNS)
		    check on an email client's IP address, as described in
		    Section 3 of <xref target="RFC7001"/>. </t>

		<t> The current set of enhanced status codes does not include
		    any code for indicating that a message is being rejected
		    or deferred due to local policy reasons related to any
		    of these mechanisms.  This is potentially useful
		    information to agents that need more than rudimentary
		    handling information about the reason a message was
		    rejected on receipt.  This document introduces enhanced
		    status codes for reporting those cases to clients. </t>

		<t> <xref target="spf-code"/> updates <xref target="RFC7208"/>,
		    as new enhanced status codes relevant to that
		    specification are being registered and recommended for
		    use. </t>

	<section anchor="discuss" title="General Considerations">
		<t> By the nature of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP),
		    only one enhanced status code can be returned for a given
		    exchange between client and server.  However, an
		    operator might decide to defer or reject a message for a
		    plurality of reasons.  Clients receiving these codes
		    need to consider that the failure reflected by one of these
		    status codes might not reflect the only reason, or
		    the most important reason, for non-acceptance of the
		    message or command. </t>

		<t> It is important to note that Section 6.1 of
		    <xref target="RFC6376"/> discourages special treatment of
		    messages bearing no valid DKIM signature.  There are some
		    operators that disregard this advice, a few of which go
		    so far as to require a valid Author Domain signature (that
		    is, one matching the domain(s) in the From header field) in
		    order to accept the message.  Moreover, some nascent
		    technologies built atop SPF and DKIM depend on such
		    authentications.  This work does not endorse
		    configurations that violate DKIM's recommendations, but
		    rather acknowledges that they do exist and merely seeks to
		    provide for improved interoperability with such
		    operators. </t>

		<t> A specific use case for these codes is mailing list
		    software, which processes rejections in order to remove
		    from the subscriber set those addresses that are no
		    longer valid.  There is a need in that case to distinguish
		    authentication failures versus indications that the
		    recipient address is no longer valid. </t>

		<t> If a receiving server performs multiple authentication
		    checks, and more than one of them fails thus warranting
		    rejection of the message, the SMTP server SHOULD use the
		    code that indicates multiple methods failed rather than
		    only reporting the first one that failed.  It may be the
		    case that one method is always expected to fail, and thus
		    returning that method's specific code is not information
		    useful to the sending agent. </t>

		<t> The reverse IP DNS check is defined in Section 2.6.3 of
		    <xref target="RFC7001"/>. </t>

		<t> Any message authentication or policy enforcement
		    technologies developed in the future should also include
		    registration of their own enhanced status codes so that
		    this kind of specific reporting is available to
		    operators that wish to use them. </t>

	<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
		<t> Use of these codes reveals local policy with respect to
		    email authentication, which can be useful information to
		    actors attempting to deliver undesired mail.  It should
		    be noted that there is no specific obligation to use these
		    codes; if an operator wishes not to reveal this aspect
		    of local policy, it can continue using a generic result
		    code such as 5.7.7, 5.7.1, or even 5.7.0. </t>
