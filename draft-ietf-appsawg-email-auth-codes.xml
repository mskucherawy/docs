	<abstract>
		<t> There is at present no way to return a status code to
		    an email client that indicates a message is
		    being rejected or deferred specifically because of email
		    authentication failures.  This document registers codes
		    for this purpose. </t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> <xref target="RFC3463"/> introduced Enhanced Mail System
		    Status Codes, and <xref target="RFC5248"/> created an IANA
		    registry for these. </t>

		<t> <xref target="RFC6376"/> and <xref target="RFC7208"/>
		    introduced, respectively, DomainKeys Identified Mail
		    and Sender Policy Framework, two protocols for conducting
		    email authentication.  Another common email acceptance
		    test is the reverse Domain Name System check on an email
		    client's IP address, as described in Section 3 of
		    <xref target="RFC7001"/>. </t>

		<t> The current set of enhanced status codes does not include
		    any code for indicating that a message is being rejected
		    or deferred due to local policy reasons related to either
		    of these two mechanisms.  This document introduces
		    enhanced status codes for reporting those cases to
		    clients. </t>

	<section anchor="discuss" title="General Considerations">
		<t> By the nature of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP),
		    only one enhanced status code can be returned for a given
		    exchange between client and server.  However, an
		    operator might decide to defer or reject a message for a
		    plurality of reasons.  Clients receiving these codes
		    need to consider that the failure reflected by one of these
		    status codes might not reflect the only reason, or
		    the most important reason, for non-acceptance of the
		    message or command. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
		<t> Use of these codes reveals local policy with respect to
		    email authentication, which can be useful information to
		    actors attempting to deliver undesirable mail.  It should
		    be noted that there is no specific obligation to use these
		    codes; if an operator wishes not to reveal this aspect
		    of local policy, it can continue using a generic result
		    code such as 5.7.7 or even 5.7.0. </t>
