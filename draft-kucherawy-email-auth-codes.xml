	<abstract>
		<t> There is at present no way to return a status code to
		    an email client that indicates a message is
		    being rejected or deferred specifically because of email
		    authentication failures.  This document registers codes
		    for this purpose. </t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> <xref target="RFC3463"/> introduced Enhanced Mail System
		    Status Codes, and <xref target="RFC5248"/> created an IANA
		    registry for these. </t>

		<t> <xref target="RFC6376"/> and <xref target="RFC4408"/>
		    introduced, respectively, DomainKeys Identified Mail
		    and Sender Policy Framework, two protocols for conducting
		    email authentication. </t>

		<t> The current set of enhanced status codes does not include
		    any code for indicating that a message is being rejected
		    or deferred due to negative results in either of these
		    two mechanisms.  This document introduces an enhanced
		    status code for reporting those cases to clients. </t>

   Description:        This status code is returned when a message
                       contained a valid DKIM signature, but the
                       signature failed to validate, contrary

		<t> Use of these codes reveals local policy with respect to
		    email authentication, which can be useful information to
		    actors attempting to deliver undesirable mail.  It should
		    be noted that there is no specific obligation to use these
		    codes; if an operator wishes not to reveal this aspect
		    of local policy, it can continue using a generic result
		    such as 5.7.7 or even 5.7.0. </t>
