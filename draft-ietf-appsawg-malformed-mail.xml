	<abstract>
		<t> Although Internet mail formats have been precisely defined
		    since the 1970s, authoring and handling software often
		    show only mild conformance to the specifications.  The
		    distributed and non-interactive nature of email has often
		    prompted adjustments to receiving software, to handle
		    these variations, rather than trying to gain better
		    conformance by senders, since the receiving operator is
		    primarily driven by complaining recipient users and has no
		    authority over the sending side of the system.  Processing
		    with such flexibility comes at some cost, since mail
		    software is faced with decisions about whether or not to
		    permit non-conforming messages to continue toward their
		    destinations unaltered, adjust them to conform (possibly
		    at the cost of losing some of the original message), or
		    outright rejecting them. </t>

		<t> A core requirement for interoperability is that both sides
		    of an exchange work from the same details and semantics.
		    By having receivers be flexible, beyond the specifications,
		    there can be -- and often has been -- a good chance that a
		    message will not be fully interoperable.  Worse, a
		    well-established pattern of tolerance for variations can
		    sometimes be used as an attack vector. </t>

		<t> This document includes a collection of the best advice
		    available regarding a variety of common malformed mail
		    situations, to be used as implementation guidance.  It
		    must be emphasized, however, that the intent of this
		    document is not to standardize malformations or otherwise
		    encourage their proliferation.  The messages are
		    manifestly malformed, and the code and culture that
		    generates them needs to be fixed.  Therefore, these
		    messages should be rejected outright if at all possible.
		    Nevertheless, many malformed messages from otherwise
		    legitimate senders are in circulation and will be for
		    some time, and, unfortunately, commercial reality shows
		    that we cannot always simply reject or discard them.
		    Accordingly, this document presents alternatives for
		    dealing with them in ways that seem to do the least
		    additional harm until the infrastructure is tightened up
		    to match the standards. </t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<section anchor="for" title="The Purpose Of This Work">
			<t> The history of email standards, going back to
			    <xref target="RFC733"/> and beyond, contains a
			    fairly rigid evolution of specifications.  But
			    implementations within that culture have also
			    long had an undercurrent known formally as the
			    robustness principle, but also known informally
			    as Postel's Law: "Be conservative in what you do,
			    be liberal in what you accept from others." </t>

			<t> Jon Postel's directive is often misinterpreted to
			    mean that any deviance from a specification is
			    acceptable.  Rather, it was intended only to
			    account for legitimate variations in
			    interpretation within specifications, as well as
			    basic transit errors, like bit errors.  Taken to
			    its unintended extreme, excessive tolerance would
			    imply that there are no limits to the liberties
			    that a sender might take, while presuming a burden
			    on a receiver to guess "correctly" at the meaning
			    of any such variation. </t>

			<t> In general, this served the email ecosystem well
			    by allowing a few errors in implementations
			    without obstructing participation in the game.
			    The proverbial bar was set low.  However, as we
			    have evolved into the current era, some of these
			    lenient stances have begun to expose opportunities
			    that can be exploited by malefactors.  Various
			    email-based applications rely on strong
			    application of these standards for simple security
			    checks, while the very basic building blocks of
			    that infrastructure, intending to be robust, fail
			    utterly to assert those standards. </t>

			<t> This document presents some areas in which the more
			    lenient stances can provide vectors for attack,
			    and then presents the collected wisdom of numerous
			    applications in and around the email ecosystem for
			    dealing with them to mitigate their impact. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="not_for" title="Not The Purpose Of This Work">
			<t> It is important to understand that this work is
			    not an effort to endorse or standardize certain
			    common malformations.  The code and culture that
			    introduces such messages into the mail stream
			    needs to be repaired, as the security penalty now
			    being paid for this lax processing arguably 
			    outweighs the reduction in support costs to end
			    users who are not expected to understand the
			    standards.  However, the reality is that this
			    will not be fixed quickly. </t>

			<t> Given this, it is beneficial to provide
			    implementers with guidance about the safest or
			    most effective way to handle malformed messages
			    when they arrive, taking into consideration the
			    tradeoffs of the choices available especially
			    with respect to how various actors in the email
			    ecosystem respond to such messages in terms of
			    handling, parsing, or rendering to end users. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="gencons" title="General Considerations">
			<t> Many deviations from message format standards
			    are considered by some receivers to be
			    strong indications that the message is undesirable,
			    i.e., is spam or contains malware.  Such receivers
			    quickly decide that the best handling choice is
			    simply to reject or discard the message.  This
			    means malformations caused by innocent
			    misunderstandings or ignorance of proper syntax
			    can cause messages with no ill intent also to fail
			    to be delivered. </t>

			<t> Senders that want to ensure message delivery are
			    best advised to adhere strictly to the relevant
			    standards (including, but not limited to,
			    <xref target="MAIL"/>, <xref target="MIME"/>,
			    and <xref target="DKIM"/>), as well as observe
			    other industry best practices such as may be
			    published from time to time either by the IETF or
			    independently. </t>

		<section anchor="examples" title="Examples">
			<t> Examples of message content include a number
			    within braces at the end of each line.  These
			    are line numbers for use in subsequent discussion,
			    and are not actually part of the message content
			    presented in the example. </t>

			<t> Blank lines are not numbered in the examples. </t>

	<section anchor="background" title="Background">
		<t> The reader would benefit from reading
		    <xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/> for some general background
		    about the overall email architecture.  Of particular
		    interest is the Internet Message Format, detailed in
		    <xref target="MAIL"/>.  Throughout this document, the
		    use of the term "message" should be assumed to mean
		    a block of text conforming to the Internet Message
		    Format. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="internal" title="Internal Representations">
		<t> Any agent handling a message could have one or two (or
		    more) distinct representations of a message it is handling.
		    One is an internal representation, such as a block of
		    storage used for the header and a block for the body.
		    These may be sorted, encoded, decoded, etc., as per the
		    needs of that particular module.  The other is the
		    representation that is output to the next agent in the
		    handling chain.  This might be identical to the version
		    that is input to the module, or it might have some changes
		    such as added or reordered header fields, body
		    modifications to remove malicious content, etc. </t>

		<t> In some cases, advice is provided only for internal
		    representations.  However, it is sometimes necessary
		    to make changes between the input and output versions
		    as well. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="constant" title="Invariant Content">
		<t> An especially interesting handling sequence occurs within
		    the destination Administrative Management Domain
		    (ADMD; see <xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/>).  From ingress to
		    the ADMD, through the boundary agent, until delivery to
		    the end user, it is beneficial to ensure that each agent
		    sees an identical form for the message.  Absent this,
		    it can be impossible for different agents in the chain
		    to make consistent assertions about the content. </t>

		<t> For example, suppose a handling agent records that a
		    message had some specific set of properties at ingress
		    to the ADMD, then permitted it to continue inbound.  Some
		    other agent alters the content for some reason.  The user,
		    on viewing the delivered content, reports the message as
		    abuse.  However, report processing often takes place at, or
		    close to, the original point of ingress and is likely to
		    be based on the set of properties recorded there, rather
		    at the end user's system.  This could render the
		    complaint inactionable.  Similarly, a message that
		    originally had properties a filtering agent would use to
		    reject an might not be rejected, and thus reach an end
		    user, if an intermediate agent altered the message in
		    a manner that alters one of those properties. </t>

		<t> Therefore, agents within an integrated message processing
		    environment will simplify operational concerns by ensuring
		    that each agent receives the same content -- except for
		    the usual handling agent trace information additions --
		    and that this is what reaches the end user, unmodified.
		    Various policies, such as special handling for detected
		    message abuse, will make exceptions appropriate. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="msa" title="Mail Submission Agents">
		<t> Within the email context, the single most influential
		    component that can reduce the presence of malformed
		    items in the email system is the Mail Handling Service
		    (MHS; see <xref target="EMAIL-ARCH"/>).  This is the
		    component that is essentially the interface between end
		    users that create content and the mail stream. </t>

		<t> MHSes need to become more strict about enforcement
		    of all relevant email standards, especially
		    <xref target="MAIL"/> and the <xref target="MIME"/>
		    family of documents. </t>

		<t> More strict conformance by relaying MTAs will also be
		    helpful.  although preventing the dissemination of
		    malformed messages is desirable, the rejection of such
		    mail already in transit also has a support cost, namely
		    the creation of a <xref target="DSN"/> that many end
		    users might not understand. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="lines" title="Line Terminaton">
		<t> For interoperable Internet Mail messages, the only
		    valid line separation sequence in messaging is
		    ASCII 0x0D ("carriage return", or CR) followed by ASCII
		    0x0A ("line feed", or LF), commonly referred to as CRLF.
		    Common UNIX user tools, however, typically only use LF
		    for internal line termination.  This means that a protocol
		    engine, which converts between UNIX and Internet Mail
		    formats, has to convert between these two end-of-line
		    representations before transmitting a message or after
		    receiving it. </t>

		<t> Non-compliant implementations can cause messages to be
		    transmitted with a mix of line terminations, such as LF
		    everywhere except CRLF only at the end of the message.
		    According to <xref target="SMTP"/> and
		    <xref target="MAIL"/>, this means the entire
		    message actually exists on a single line. </t>

		<t> Within modern Internet Mail it is highly unlikely that
		    an isolated CR or LF is valid in common ASCII text.
		    Furthermore <xref target="MIME"/> presents mechanisms for
		    encoding content that actually does need to contain such
		    an unusual character sequence. </t>

		<t> Thus, it will typically be safe and helpful to treat a
		    naked CR or LF as equivalent to a CRLF when parsing
		    a message. </t>

	<section anchor="header" title="Header Anomalies">
		<t> This section covers common syntactical and semantic
		    anomalies found in a message header, and presents
		    preferred mitigations. </t>

		<section anchor="obsolete"
		         title="Converting Obsolete and Invalid Syntaxes">
			<t> A message using an obsolete header syntax might
			    confound an agent that is attempting to be robust
			    in its handling of syntax variations.  A bad
			    actor could exploit such a weakness in order to
			    get abuse or malicious content through a filter.
			    This section presents some examples of such
			    variations.  Messages including them ought be
			    rejected; where this is not possible, recommended
			    internal interpretations are provided. </t>

			<section anchor="hostaddr" title="Host-Address Syntax">
				<t> The following obsolete syntax attempts
				    to specify source routing:

				    <figure><artwork>
    To: &lt;@example.net:fran@example.com&gt;
				    </artwork></figure> </t>

				<t> This means "send to fran@example.com via
				    the mail service at example.net".  It
				    can safely be interpreted as:

				    <figure><artwork>
    To: &lt;fran@example.com&gt;
				    </artwork></figure> </t>
			</section>

			<section anchor="angle"
			         title="Excessive Angle Brackets">
				<t> The following over-use of angle brackets, e.g.:

				    <figure><artwork>
    To: &lt;&lt;&lt;user2@example.org&gt;&gt;&gt;
				    </artwork></figure> </t>

				<t> can safely be interpreted as:

				    <figure><artwork>
    To: &lt;user2@example.org&gt;

			<section anchor="angle2"
			         title="Unbalanced Angle Brackets">

				    <figure><artwork>
    To: &lt;another@example.net

				<t> where "example.net" is the domain name
				    or host name of the handling agent
				    making the interpretation. </t>
			</section>
		</section>

		<section anchor="non-headers" title="Non-Header Lines">
			<t> Some messages contain
			    a line of text in the header that is not a valid
			    message header field of any kind.  For example:

			    <figure><artwork>
    From: user@example.com {1}
    To: userpal@example.net {2}
    Subject: This is your reminder {3}
    about the football game tonight {4}
    Date: Wed, 20 Oct 2010 20:53:35 -0400 {5}

    Don't forget to meet us for the tailgate party! {7}
			    </artwork></figure> </t>

			<t> The cause of this is typically a bug in a message
			    generator of some kind.  Line {4} was intended to
			    be a continuation of line {3}; it should have been
			    indented by whitespace as set out in Section 2.2.3
			    of <xref target="MAIL"/>.  </t>

			<t> This anomaly has varying impacts on processing
			    software, depending on the implementation:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> some agents choose to separate the header
				    of the message from the body only at the
				    first empty line (i.e. a CRLF immediately
				    followed by another CRLF); </t>

				<t> some agents assume this anomaly should
				    be interpreted to mean the body starts
				    at line {4}, as the end of the header
				    is assumed by encountering something that
				    is not a valid header field or folded
				    portion thereof; </t>

				<t> some agents assume this should be
				    interpreted as an intended header folding
				    as described above and thus simply
				    append a single space character (ASCII
				    0x20) and the content of line {4} to
				    that of line {3}; </t>

				<t> some agents reject this outright as line
				    {4} is neither a valid header field nor
				    a folded continuation of a header
				    field prior to an empty line. </t>
			    </list></t>

			<t> This can be exploited if it is known that one
			    message handling agent will take one action
			    while the next agent in the handling chain will
			    take another.  Consider, for example, a message
			    filter that searches message headers for properties
			    indicative of abusive of malicious content that is
			    attached to a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)
			    implementing option 2 above.  An attacker could
			    craft a message that includes this malformation at
			    a position above the property of interest, knowing
			    the MTA will not consider that content part of
			    the header, and thus the MTA will not feed it
			    to the filter, thus avoiding detection.  Meanwhile,
			    the Mail User Agent (MUA) which presents the
			    content to an end user, implements option 1 or 3,
			    which has some undesirable effect. </t>

			<t> It should be noted that a few implementations
			    choose option 4 above since any reputable message
			    generation program will get header folding right,
			    and thus anything so blatant as this malformation
			    is likely an error caused by a malefactor. </t>

			<t> The preferred implementation if option 4 above is
			    not employed is to apply the following heuristic
			    when this malformation is detected:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> Search forward for an empty line.  If one
				    is found, then apply option 3 above to the
				    anomalous line, and continue. </t>

				<t> Search forward for another line that
				    appears to be a new header field, i.e.,
				    a name followed by a colon.  If one is
				    found, then apply option 3 above to the
				    anomalous line, and continue. </t>
			    </list> </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="spacing" title="Unusual Spacing">
			<t> The following message is valid per
			    <xref target="MAIL"/>:

			    <figure><artwork>
    From: user@example.com {1}
    To: userpal@example.net {2}
    Subject: This is your reminder {3}
     {4}
     about the football game tonight {5}
    Date: Wed, 20 Oct 2010 20:53:35 -0400 {6}

    Don't forget to meet us for the tailgate party! {8}
			    </artwork></figure> </t>

			<t> Line {4} contains a single whitespace.  The
			    intended result is that lines {3}, {4}, and {5}
			    comprise a single continued header field.  However,
			    some agents are aggressive at stripping trailing
			    whitespace, which will cause line {4} to be
			    treated as an empty line, and thus the separator
			    line between header and body.  This can affect
			    header-specific processing algorithms as described
			    in the previous section. </t>

			<t> This example was legal in earlier versions of the
			    Internet Mail format standard. </t>

			<t> The best handling of this example is for a
			    message parsing engine to behave as if line {4}
			    was not present in the message and for a message
			    creation engine to emit the message with line {4}
			    removed. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="malformations" title="Header Malformations">
			<t> Among the many possible malformations, a
			    common one is insertion of whitespace at
			    unusual locations, such as:

			    <figure><artwork>
    From: user@example.com {1}
    To: userpal@example.net {2}
    Subject: This is your reminder {3}
    MIME-Version : 1.0 {4}
    Content-Type: text/plain {5}
    Date: Wed, 20 Oct 2010 20:53:35 -0400 {6}

    Don't forget to meet us for the tailgate party! {8}
			    </artwork></figure> </t>

			<t> Note the addition of whitespace in line {4}
			    after the header field name but before the colon
			    that separates the name from the value. </t>

			<t> The acceptance grammar of <xref target="MAIL"/>
			    permits that extra whitespace, so it cannot be
			    considered invalid.  However, a consensus of
			    implementations prefers to remove that whitespace.
			    There is no perceived change to the semantics of
			    the header field being altered as the whitespace
			    is itself semantically meaningless.  Therefore,
			    it is best to remove all whitespace after the
			    field name but before the colon and to emit the
			    field in this modified form. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="counts" title="Header Field Counts">
			<t> Section 3.6 of <xref target="MAIL"/> prescribes
			    specific header field counts for a valid
			    message.  Few agents actually enforce these
			    in the sense that a message whose header contents
			    exceed one or more limits set there are generally
			    allowed to pass; they typically add any required
			    fields that are missing, however.  </t>

			<t> Also, few agents that use messages as input,
			    including Mail User Agents (MUAs) that actually
			    display messages to users, verify that the input
			    is valid before proceeding.  Some popular open
			    source filtering programs and some popular Mailing
			    List Management (MLM) packages select either the
			    first or last instance of a particular field name,
			    such as From, to decide who sent a message.  Absent
			    strict enforcement of <xref target="MAIL"/>, an
			    attacker can craft a message with multiple fields
			    if that attacker knows the filter will make a
			    decision based on one but the user will be shown
			    the other. </t>

			<t> This situation is exacerbated when message validity
			    is assessed, such as through enhanced
			    authentication methods.  Such methods might cover
			    one instance of a constrained field but not
			    another, taking the wrong one as "good" or "safe". 
			    An MUA, for example could show the first of two
			    From fields to an end user as "good" or "safe"
			    while an authentication method actually only
			    verified the second. </t>

			<t> In attempting to counter this exposure, one of
			    the following can be enacted:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> reject outright or refuse to process
				    further any input message that does not
				    conform to Section 3.6 of
				    <xref target="MAIL"/>; </t>

				<t> remove or, in the case of an MUA, refuse
				    to render any instances of a header field
				    whose presence exceeds a limit prescribed
				    in Section 3.6 of
				    <xref target="MAIL"/> when generating its
				    output; </t>

				<t> alter the name of any header field 
				    whose presence exceeds a limit prescribed
				    in Section 3.6 of
				    <xref target="MAIL"/> when generating its
				    output so that later agents can produce a
				    consistent result.  Any alteration likely
				    to cause the field to be ignored by
				    downstream agents is acceptable.  A common
				    approach is to prefix the field names
				    with a string such as "BAD-". </t>
			    </list> </t>

			<t> Selecting a mitigation action from the above list,
			    or some other action, must consider the needs
			    of the operator making the decision, and the
			    nature of its user base. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="missing" title="Missing Header Fields">
			<t> Similar to the previous section, there are
			    messages seen in the wild that lack certain
			    required header fields.  In particular,
			    <xref target="MAIL"/> requires that a From and
			    Date field be present in all messages. </t>

			<t> When presented with a message lacking these fields,
			    the MTA might perform one of the following:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> Make no changes </t>

				<t> Add an instance of the missing field(s)
				    using synthesized content based on
				    data provided in other parts of the
				    protocol </t>
			    </list> </t>

			<t> Option 2 is recommended for handling this
			    case.  Handling agents should add these for
			    internal hanlding if they are missing, but should
			    not add them to the external representation. 
			    The reason for this advice is that there
			    are some filter modules that would consider the
			    absence of such fields to be a condition warranting
			    special treatment (e.g., rejection), and thus the
			    effectiveness of such modules would be stymied by
			    an upstream filter adding them in a way visible
			    to other components. </t>

			<t> The synthesized fields should contain a best
			    guess as to what should have been there; for From,
			    the SMTP MAIL command's address can be used
			    (if not null) or a placeholder address followed
			    by an address literal (e.g., unknown@[192.0.2.1]);
			    for Date, a date extracted from a Received field
			    is a reasonable choice. </t>

			<t> One other important case to consider is a missing
			    Message-Id field.  An MTA that encounters a message
			    missing this field should synthesize a valid one
			    using techniques described above and add it to the
			    external rpresentation, since many deployed tools
			    use the content of that field as a common unique
			    message reference, so its absence inhibits
			    correlation of message processing. One possible
			    synthesis would be based on based on an encoding of
			    the current date/time and an internal MTA ID (e.g.,
			    queue ID) followed by @ and the fully qualified
			    hostname of the machine synthesizing the header
			    value.  For example:

			    <figure><artwork>
    tm = gmtime(&now);
    (void) snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%04d%02d%02d%02d%02d.%s@%s",
                    tm->tm_year + 1900, tm->tm_mon + 1, tm->tm_mday,
                    tm->tm_hour, tm->tm_min, queueID, fqhn);
			    </artwork></figure> </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="8bit" title="Eight-Bit Data">
			<t> Standards-compliant mail messages that contain
			    non-ASCII data are required to self-label this
			    through the use of <xref target="MIME">/>.  If
			    the representation of the non-ASCII data is in
			    an 8-bit mode (rather than special encoding so
			    that it retains a 7-bit base), then this must
			    be signaled through the use of
			    <xref target="SMTP"/> extensions. </t>

			<t> Non-ASCII data otherwise found in messages
			    can confound code that is used to analyze content.
			    For example, a null (ASCII 0x00) byte inside
			    a message can cause typical string processing
			    functions to mis-identify the end of a string,
			    which can be exploited to hide malicious content
			    from analysis processes. </t>

			<t> Handling agents MUST reject messages containing
			    null bytes that are not encoded in some standard
			    way, and SHOULD reject other non-ASCII bytes that
			    are similarly not encoded.  If rejection is not
			    done, an ASCII-compatible encoding such as those
			    defined in <xref target="MIME"/> SHOULD be
			    used. </t>

	<section anchor="mime" title="MIME Anomalies">
		<t> <xref target="MIME"/>, et seq, include a mechanism of
		    message extensions for providing text in character sets
		    other than ASCII, non-text attachments to messages,
		    multi-part message bodies, and similar facilities. </t>

		<t> Some anomalies with MIME-compliant generation are also
		    common.  This section discusses some of those and
		    presents preferred mitigations. </t>

		<section anchor="hdrnames" title="Header Field Names">
			<t> <xref target="MAIL"/> permits header field names
			    to begin with "--".  This means that a header
			    field name can look like a <xref target="MIME"/>
			    multipart boundary.  For example:

			    <figure><artwork>
  --foo:bar
			    </artwork></figure> </t>

			<t> This is a legal header field, whose name is
			    "--foo" and whose value is "bar".  Thus, consider
			    this header:

			    <figure><artwork>
    From: user@example.com {1}
    To: userpal@example.net {2}
    Subject: This is your reminder {3}
    Date: Wed, 20 Oct 2010 20:53:35 -0400 {4}
    MIME-Version: 1.0 {5}
    Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="foo:bar" {6}
    --foo:bar {7}
    Malicious-Content: muahaha {8}
			    </artwork></figure> </t>

			<t> Note that there has been no blank line separating
			    the header from the body yet, so the text at line
			    {7} is not in the body and thus cannot be an
			    active boundary marker.  Still, one implementation
			    could observe that line {7} announces the
			    beginning of the first MIME part while another
			    considers it a part of the message's header. </t>

			<t> If an agent detecting such an anomaly cannot
			    enact rejection, the agent needs to treat line
			    {7} as part of the message's header block and not
			    a MIME boundary. </t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="no_version" title="Missing MIME-Version Field">
			<t> Any message that uses <xref target="MIME"/>
			    constructs is required to have a MIME-Version
			    header field.  Without it, the Content-Type
			    and associated fields have no semantic
			    meaning. </t>

			<t> It is often observed that a message has complete
			    MIME structure, yet lacks this header field. </t>

			<t> As described at the end of
			    <xref target="non-headers"/>, this is not expected
			    from a reputable content generator and is often
			    an indication of mass-produced spam or other
			    undesirable messages. </t>

			<t> Therefore, an agent compliant with this
			    specification MUST internally enact one or more of
			    the following in the absence of a MIME-Version
			    header field:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> Ignore all other MIME-specific fields,
				    even if they are syntactically valid,
				    thus treating the entire message as a
				    single-part message of type
				    text/plain; </t>

				<t> Remove all other MIME-specific fields,
				    even if they are syntactically valid,
				    both internally and when emitting the
				    output version of the message; </t>
			    </list> </t>

	<section anchor="body" title="Body Anomalies">
		<section anchor="longlines" title="Oversized Lines">
			<t> A message containing a line of content that
			    exceeds 998 characters plus the line terminator
			    (1000 total) violates Section 2.1.1 of
			    <xref target="MAIL"/>.  Some handling
			    agents may not look at content in a single line
			    past the first 998 bytes, providing bad actors
			    an opportunity to hide malicious content. </t>

			<t> There is no specified way to handle such messages,
			    other than to observe that they are non-compliant
			    and reject them, or rewrite the oversized line
			    such that the message is compliant. </t>

			<t> Handling agents MUST take one of the following
			    actions:

			    <list style="numbers">
				<t> Break such lines into multiple lines at
				    a position that does not change the

				    For example, breaking an oversized line
				    such that a <xref target="URI"/> then
				    spans two lines could inhibit the proper
				    identification of that URI. </t>

				<t> Rewrite the MIME part (or the entire
				    message if not MIME) that contains the
				    excessively long line using a content
				    encoding that breaks the line in the
				    transmission but would still result in
				    the line being intact on decoding for

				<abstract>
					<t> DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
					    defines a domain-level
					    authentication framework for email
					    using public-key cryptography and
					    key server technology to permit
					    verification of the source and
					    contents of messages by either
					    Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) or
					    Mail User Agents (MUAs).  The
					    ultimate goal of this framework is
					    to permit a signing domain to
					    assert responsibility for a
					    message, thus protecting message
					    signer identity and the integrity
					    of the messages they convey while
					    retaining the functionality of
					    Internet email as it is known
					    today.  Protection of email
					    identity may assist in the global
					    control of "spam" and "phishing".
