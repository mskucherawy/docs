    <abstract>
      <t>While locating the target host in IPv4 is well defined, this process is unclear for sytems in IPv4 and IPv6 environemt. This specification extends <xref target="RFC5321">RFC&nbsp;5321</xref> to provide a standard way of selecting the target host in mixed environements.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Target host selection is discussed in <xref target="RFC5321">RFC&nbsp;5321</xref> and some operational experience is described in <xref target="RFC3974">RFC&nbsp;3974</xref>. However the process is unclear when selecting the target host in a mixed environment. This specification addresses this issue and also defines how a receiving MTA can indicate to a sendind MTA to fall back to IPv4 for a message.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Rationale">
        <t><xref target="RFC5321">RFC&nbsp;5321</xref> section 5.2 specifically discusses SMTP implementations taking into account 'local circumstances' when deciding which network addresses to use.  However, neither it nor [RFC3974] explore what 'local circumstances' should be evaluated or how they should be evaluated.  The result has thus far been an inconsistent set of SMTP client implementations.  Providing a guideline for how SMTP client implementations should handle various dual-stack situations will improve the stability of the network while we operate in a dual- stack mode (which will likely be for an extended period of time).</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Locating the target host">
      <t>This part applies if one or more MX RR are found for a given name and if the sender-SMTP server is IPV4 and/or IPv6 capable.</t>

      <t>When a domain name associated with an MX RR is looked up and the associated data field obtained, the data field of that response MUST contain a domain name.  That domain name MUST be queried for A RR if the sender-SMTP is IPv4 capable and MUST be queried for AAAA RR if the sender-SMTP is IPv6 capable. A list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the SMTP servers to which the message should be directed is therefore built.</t>

      <t>When there are more than one MX RR associated to the given domain, the above process is done for each MX RR. An ordered list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses is then established using the MX RR preference. Lower numbers are more preferred than higher ones.</t>

      <t>The sender-SMTP server SHOULD first try all the IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) with higher preference (lower number) before the IP addresses with lower preference (higher number). The sender-SMTP server SHOULD try all the addresses up to a limit before deciding if the message is deliverable or not. the sender-SMTP server SHOULD try at least two addresses.</t>

      <t>For the same MX RR preference when there is more than one IP address (IPv4/IPv6) to be tried, the sender-SMTP SHOULD maintain an internal sub preference list based on the rate of successful delivery of messages and based on the speed of such delivery. If such internal sub preference list is not established or cannot be established then the sender-SMTP SHOULD try randomly any address within the same preference. Using this method the sender-SMTP will not prefer IP addresses it cannot connect to, or IP addresses with more rejection or latency. In some way this strategy is similar to web browsers that initiate connection to the web server using IPv4 and IPv6 and select the one with better response.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Indicating the sender-SMTP server to fall back to IPv4">
      <t>To move from IP based reputation to a domain based reputation system for email, a receiver-SMTP MAY require that messages pass SPF (<xref target="RFC6652">RFC&nbsp;6652</xref>) or DKIM (<xref target="RFC6376">RFC&nbsp;6376</xref>). This section does not discuss the merit of such policy but proposes mechanisms for any policy to get the sender-SMTP to fall back to IPv4 from an IPv6 connection.</t>
      <section title="With the service extension IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK ">
        <t>The receiver-SMTP MAY addvertise a service extension IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK , which the sender-SMTP MUST reply by IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK if capable</t>
        <t>In this condition for each message not acceptable due to policy where a retry over IPv4 is requested, the sender-SMTP server MUST reply by the reply code 456, where the sender-SMTP MUST requeue the message for immediate retry over IPv4.</t>
        <t>The SMTP enhanced status code SHOULD be 4.4.8.</t>
        <t>453 The receiver-SMTP is requiring the sender-SMTP to retry immediately the message over IPv4.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Without service extension">
        <t>The receiver-SMTP server MAY reject a message sent over IPv6 and request the sender-SMTP to retry over IPv4. In such case the SMTP reject code SHOULD be 451 if done at connection time and 421 if done later. The SMTP enhanced status code SHOULD be 4.4.8.</t>
        <t>The rejection at connection time MAY be issued only when it has been demonstrated that a majority of messages would not pass the policy and that the sender-SMTP is not capable of the service extension IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK.</t>
        <t>The rejection at connection time SHOULD be for a limited time to give a chance for later messages to be re-evaluted against the policy.</t>
        <t>453 is not used here, as it is not sure that sender-SMTP without the above service extension would behave as expected.</t>

      <t>Sender-SMTP may not fall back to IPv4 when requested and keep retrying over and over on IPv6. MTA administrators SHOULD monitor for such servers. MTA Administrators MAY Whitelist them to accept messages over IPv6 or take appropriate action.</t> 
      <t>Messages may start to queue on the sender-SMTP side and the mail administrator may not notice it or take appropriate action in time.</t>
      <t>If the policy is not explained clearly the mail administrator may not know what is required to pass the policy.</t>
      <t>If the policy is to cumbersome and is not based on widely adopted standards and recommendations, the mail administrator may decide not to jump through hoops to get the email delivered.</t>
      <t>The fall back mechanism without service extension may create unecessary burden for the sender as well as the receiver.</t>
