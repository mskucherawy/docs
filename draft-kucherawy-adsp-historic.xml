	<abstract>
		<t> Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP) is a protocol
		    adjunct to DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) designed
		    to allow a domain owner to advertise a very narrow, strict
		    handling policy for that domain's email.  Since its
		    publication in 2009, it has seen very little adoption
		    and support, in part because of its narrow application
		    space and in part due to the destructive impact it can
		    have when not used carefully.  It has not lived up to
		    its intended purpose. </t>

		<t> As more modern protocols are under development that will
		    take a more cautious approach to email security in terms
		    of authentic use of identifiers, ADSP should be considered
		    deprecated and phased out as soon as practical. </t>

	<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
		<t> DomainKeys Identified Mail <xref target="DKIM"/> defines
		    a mechanism whereby a verified domain name can be attached
		    to a message, or portion of a message, using a
		    cryptographic signature.  It does not, however, assert
		    that this domain name matches a domain name found anywhere
		    else in the message. </t>

		<t> Author Domain Signing Practices <xref target="ADSP"/>
		    was developed as an add-on to DKIM that establishes a
		    binding between the domain name validated by DKIM and 
		    the one visible in the From: field on a message.  In
		    essence, the ADSP test is satisfied if there exists
		    on the message a DKIM signature whose domain name matches
		    the one in the From: field of the message being checked.
		    For instances where this test fails, ADSP further offers a
		    mechanism for a domain name owner to publish via the
		    Domain Name System a policy statement requesting that a
		    mail receiver prevent delivery of the message. </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="disc" title="Discussion">
		<t> Although the intent of ADSP is noble enough, namely
		    suppression of improper (i.e., fraudulent) use of a
		    domain name for the purposes of abuse, its mechanism
		    establishes undesirable constraints on the email
		    ecosystem.  Using DKIM With Mailing Lists
		    <xref target="DKIM-MLM"/> gives a fairly thorough
		    treatment of these, particularly:

		    <list style="symbols">
			<t> Destructive interaction with mailing lists
			    (Section 5.2) </t>

			<t> The need to create distinct message streams,
			    which imposes an operational burden on the user
			    base (Section 4.1) </t>
		    </list> </t>

		<t> Other protocols are now under development that are taking a
		    more cautious approach to the conditions under which
		    a message can be blocked from delivery, and include
		    extensive reporting mechanisms for diagnosing the causes
		    of blocked messages. </t>

		<t> Generally, the cost of using ADSP is higher than the
		    benefits it conveys, and is being gradually eclipsed
		    by new work.  Thus, this document obsoletes ADSP and
		    changes its status to "Historic". </t>
