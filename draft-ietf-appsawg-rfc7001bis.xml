                <t> This document specifies a message header field called
                    Authentication-Results for use with
                    electronic mail messages to indicate the results of
                    message authentication efforts.  Any receiver-side
                    software, such as mail filters or Mail User Agents
                    (MUAs), can use this header field to relay that
                    information in a convenient and meaningful way to users
                    or to make sorting and filtering decisions. </t>

        <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
                <t> This document describes a header field called
                    Authentication-Results for electronic mail messages that
                    presents the results of a message authentication effort
                    in a machine-readable format.  The intent of the header
                    field is to create a place to collect such data when
                    message authentication mechanisms are in use so that a
                    Mail User Agent (MUA) and downstream filters can make
                    filtering decisions and/or provide a recommendation to the
                    user as to the validity of the message's origin and
		    possibly the safety and integrity of its content. </t>

                <t> This document revises the original definition found in
                    <xref target="RFC5451"/> based upon various authentication
                    protocols in current use and incorporates errata logged
                    since the publication of the original specification. </t>

                <t> End users are not expected to be direct consumers of this
                    header field.  This header field is intended for
                    consumption by programs that will then use such data or
                    render it in a human-usable form. </t>

                <t> This document specifies the format of this header
                    field and discusses the implications of its presence or
                    absence.  However, it does not discuss how the data
                    contained in the header field ought to be used, such as
		    what filtering decisions are appropriate or how an MUA
		    might render those results, as these are local policy
		    and/or user interface design questions that are not
		    appropriate for this document. </t>

                <t> At the time of publication of this document, the following
                    are published, domain-level email authentication methods in
                    common use:

                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t> Author Domain Signing Practices
                            (<xref target="ADSP"/>) </t>
                            <t> SMTP Service Extension for Authentication
                            (<xref target="AUTH"/>) </t>
                        <t> DomainKeys Identified Mail Signatures
                            (<xref target="DKIM"/>) </t>
                        <t> Sender Policy Framework (<xref target="SPF"/>) </t>
                        <t> Vouch By Reference (<xref target="VBR"/>) </t>
                        <t> reverse IP address name validation
                            ("iprev", defined in <xref target="iprev"/>) </t>
                    </list> </t>

                <t> In addition, the following are non-standard methods
                    recognized by this specification that are no longer common:

                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t> DomainKeys (<xref target="DOMAINKEYS"/>)
                             (Historic) </t>
                        <t> Sender ID (<xref target="SENDERID"/>)
                            (Experimental) </t>
                    </list> </t>

                <t> This specification is not intended to be restricted to
                    domain-based authentication schemes, but the existing
                    schemes in that family have proven to be a good starting
                    point for implementations.  The goal is to give current
                    and future authentication schemes a common framework within
                    which to deliver their results to downstream agents and
                    discourage the creation of unique header fields for
                    each. </t>

                <t> Although SPF defined a header field called "Received-SPF"
                    and the historic DomainKeys defined one called
                    "DomainKey-Status" for this purpose, those header fields
		    are specific to the conveyance of their respective results
		    only and thus are insufficient to satisfy the requirements
                    enumerated below.  In addition, many SPF implementations
                    have adopted the header field specified here at least as
                    an option, and DomainKeys has been obsoleted by DKIM. </t>

                <section anchor="purpose" title="Purpose">
                        <t> The header field defined in this document is
                            expected to serve several purposes:

                        <list style="numbers">
                                <t> Convey the results of various message
                                    authentication checks, which are applied by
                                    upstream filters and Mail Transfer
                                    Agents (MTAs) and then passed to MUAs and
                                    downstream filters within the same "trust
                                    domain".  Such agents might wish to render
                                    those results to end users or to use those
                                    data to apply more or less stringent
				    content checks based on authentication
                                    results; </t>

                                <t> Provide a common location within a message
                                    for this data; </t>

                                <t> Create an extensible framework for
                                    reporting new authentication methods as
                                    they emerge. </t>
                        </list> </t>

                        <t> In particular, the mere presence of this header
                            field does not mean its contents are valid.
                            Rather, the header field is reporting assertions
                            made by one or more authentication schemes 
                            (supposedly) applied somewhere upstream.
                            For an MUA or downstream filter to treat the
                            assertions as actually valid, there must be an
                            assessment of the trust relationship among such
                            agents, the validating MTA, and the mechanism for
                            conveying the information. </t>
                </section>

                <section anchor="trust" title="Trust Boundary">
                        <t> This document makes several references to the
                            "trust boundary" of an administrative management
                            domain (ADMD).  Given the diversity among existing
                            mail environments, a precise definition of this
                            term isn't possible. </t>

                        <t> Simply put, a transfer from the producer of the
                            header field to the consumer must occur within a
                            context that permits the consumer to treat
                            assertions by the producer as being reliable and
                            accurate (trustworthy).  How this trust is obtained
                            is outside the scope of this document.  It is
                            entirely a local matter. </t>

                        <t> Thus, this document defines a "trust boundary" as
                            the delineation between "external" and "internal"
                            entities.  Services that are internal -- within the
                            trust boundary -- are provided by the ADMD's
                            infrastructure for its users.  Those that are
                            external are outside of the authority of the
                            ADMD.  By this definition, hosts that are within
                            a trust boundary are subject to the ADMD's
			    authority and policies, independent of their
			    physical placement or their physical operation.
			    For example, a host within a trust boundary might
			    actually be operated by a remote service provider
			    and reside physically within its data center. </t>

                        <t> It is possible for a message to be evaluated inside
                            a trust boundary but then depart and re-enter the
                            trust boundary.  An example might be a forwarded
                            message such as a message/rfc822 attachment
                            (see Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
                            <xref target="MIME"/>) or one that is part of a
                            multipart/digest.  The details reported by this
			    field cannot be trusted in that case.  Thus, this
			    field found within one of those media types is
			    typically ignored. </t>
                </section>

                <section anchor="scope" title="Processing Scope">
                        <t> The content of this header field is meant to convey
                            to message consumers that authentication work on
                            the message was already done within its trust
                            boundary, and those results are being presented.
                            It is not intended to provide message parameters
                            to consumers so that they can perform
			    authentication protocols on their own. </t>

                                    recent message security work has given rise
                                    to slightly different definitions, and

                                    usages, as follows:

                                    <list style="symbols">
                                        <t> "Authorization" is the

                                            identity.  In this context,
                                            authorization indicates that a
                                            message from a particular ADMD
                                            arrived via a route the ADMD
                                            has explicitly approved. </t>

                                        <t> "Authentication" is the assertion

                                            in its entirety. </t>
                                    </list> </t>

                                <t> As examples: SPF and Sender ID
                                    are authorization mechanisms in that they
                                    express a result that shows whether or not
				    the ADMD that apparently sent the message
				    has explicitly authorized the connecting
				    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
				    (<xref target="SMTP"/>) client to relay
				    messages on its behalf, but they do not
				    actually validate any other property of
				    the message itself.  By contrast, DKIM
                                    is agnostic as to the routing of a message

                                    modified in transit.  Since the signatures
                                    are not tied to SMTP connections, they can
                                    be added by either the ADMD of origin,
                                    intermediate ADMDs (such as a mailing list
                                    server), other handling agents, or any
                                    combination. </t>

                                <t> Generally, it is assumed that the work of
                                    applying message authentication schemes
                                    takes place at a border MTA or a delivery
                                    MTA.  This specification is written with
                                    that assumption in mind.  However, there
                                    are some sites at which the entire mail
                                    infrastructure consists of a single host.
                                    In such cases, such terms as "border MTA"
                                    and "delivery MTA" might well apply to the
                                    same machine or even the very same agent.
                                    It is also possible that some message
                                    authentication tests could take place on
                                    an intermediate MTA.  Although this
                                    document doesn't specifically describe
                                    such cases, they are not meant to be
                                    excluded. </t>

                            validation mechanisms to communicate output to
                            one or more separate assessment mechanisms.  These
                            mechanisms operate within a unified trust boundary
                            that defines an Administrative Management Domain
                            (ADMD).  An ADMD contains one or more entities
                            that perform validation and generate the header
                            field and one or more that consume it for some
                            type of assessment.  The field often contains no
                            integrity or validation mechanism of its own, so
                            its presence must be trusted implicitly.  Hence,
                            valid use of the header field requires removing
                            any occurrences of it that are present when the
                            message enters the ADMD.  This ensures that later
                            occurrences have been added within the trust

                        <t> The header field specified here is called
                            Authentication-Results.  It is a Structured
                            Header Field as defined in Internet Message
                            Format (<xref target="MAIL"/>), and thus all of

                        <t> This header field is added at the top of the
			    message as it transits MTAs that do authentication
			    checks, so some idea of how far away the checks

			    considered to be a trace field as defined in
			    <xref target="MAIL"/>, and thus all of the related
			    definitions in that document apply.  </t>

                        <t> The value of the header field (after removing
                            comments) consists of an authentication
                            identifier, an optional version, and then a series
			    of statements and supporting data.  The statements
			    are of the form "method=result" and indicate which
			    authentication method(s) were applied and their
			    respective results.  For each such statement, the
			    supporting data can include a "reason" string and
			    one or more "property=value" statements indicating
			    which message properties were evaluated to reach
			    that conclusion. </t>

                        <t> The header field can appear more than once in a
                            single message, more than one result can be

			<t> Legal values of "ptype" are as defined in the

			    <list style="hanging">
				<t hangText="body:"> Information
					that was extracted from the body of the
				        message.  This might be an arbitrary

				<t hangText="header:"> Indicates information

			<t> A special ptype value of "policy" is also defined.
			    This ptype is provided to indicate that some
			    local policy mechanism was applied that augments
			    or even replaces (i.e., overrides) the result
			    returned by the authentication mechanism.  The
			    property and value in this case identify the
			    local policy that was applied and the result it
			    returned.</t>

			<t> For example, a DKIM signature is not required to
			    include the Subject header field in the set of
			    fields that are signed.  An ADMD receiving such
			    a message might decide that such a signature is
			    unacceptable, even if it passes, because the
			    content of the Subject header field could be
			    altered post-signing without invalidating the
			    signature.  Such an ADMD could replace the DKIM
			    "pass" result with a "policy" result and then
			    also include the following in the corresponding
			    Authentication-Result field: </t>

			    <figure><artwork>
   ... dkim=fail policy.dkim-rules=unsigned-subject ...
			    </artwork></figure>

			<t> In this case, the property is "dkim-rules",
			    indicating some local check by that name took
			    place and that check returned a result of
			    "unsigned-subject".  These are arbitrary names
			    selected by (and presumably used within) the
			    ADMD making use of them, so they are not normally
			    registered with IANA or otherwise specified apart
			    from setting syntax restrictions that allow for
			    easy parsing within the rest of the header
			    field. </t>

			<t> This ptype existed in the original specification
			    for this header field, but without a complete
			    description or example of intended use.  As a
			    result, it has not seen any practical use to date
			    that matches its intended purpose.  These added
			    details are provided to guide implementers toward

                <section anchor="identifier"
                        title="Authentication Identifier Field">
                        <t> Every Authentication-Results header field 
                            has an authentication service identifier field
                            (authserv-id above).  Specifically, this is any
                            string intended to identify the authentication
                            service within the ADMD that conducted
                            authentication checks on the message.  This
                            identifier is intended to be machine-readable and
			    not necessarily meaningful to users. </t>

                        <t> Since agents consuming this field will use this
                            identifier to determine whether its contents
                            are of interest (and are safe to use), the
                            uniqueness of the identifier MUST be guaranteed by
                            the ADMD that generates it and MUST pertain to
                            that ADMD.  MUAs or downstream filters SHOULD use
			    this identifier to determine whether or not the
			    data contained in an Authentication-Results header
			    field ought to be used or ignored. </t>

                        <t> For simplicity and scalability, the authentication
                            service identifier SHOULD be a common token used
                            throughout the ADMD.  Common practice is to use
                            the DNS domain name used by or within that ADMD,
                            sometimes called the "organizational domain",
                            but this is not strictly necessary. </t>

                        <t> For tracing and debugging purposes, the
                            authentication identifier can instead be the
			    specific hostname of the MTA performing the
			    authentication check whose result is being
			    reported.  Moreover, some implementations define
			    a substructure to the identifier; these are
			    outside of the scope of this specification. </t>

                        <t> Note, however, that using a local, relative
			    identifier like a flat hostname, rather
                            than a hierarchical and globally unique ADMD
                            identifier like a DNS domain name, makes
                            configuration more difficult for large sites.  The
                            hierarchical identifier permits aggregating
                            related, trusted systems together under a single,
                            parent identifier, which in turn permits assessing
                            the trust relationship with a single reference.
                            The alternative is a flat namespace requiring
                            individually listing each trusted system.  Since
                            consumers will use the identifier to determine
                            whether to use the contents of the header field:

                                <t> Changes to the identifier impose a large,
                                    centralized administrative burden. </t>

                                <t> Ongoing administrative changes require
                                    constantly updating this centralized
                                    table, making it difficult to ensure
                                    that an MUA or downstream filter will have
                                    access to accurate information for

                                    of the header field will need to know not
                                    only the current identifier(s) in use
                                    but previous ones as well to account

                        <t> The grammar above provides for the optional
                            inclusion of versions on both the header field
                            itself (attached to the authserv-id token)
                            and on each of the methods being reported.
                            The method version refers to the method itself,
                            which is specified in the documents describing
                            those methods, while the authserv-id version
                            refers to this document and thus the syntax of
                            this header field. </t>

                        <t> The purpose of including these is to avoid
                            misinterpretation of the results.  That is,
                            if a parser finds a version after an
                            authserv-id that it does not explicitly
                            know, it can immediately discontinue trying to
                            parse since what follows might not be in an
                            expected format.  For a method version, the
                            parser SHOULD ignore a method result if the
                            version is not supported in case the semantics
                            of the result have a different meaning than what
                            is expected.  For example, if a hypothetical
                            DKIM version 2 yielded a "pass" result for
                            different reasons than version 1 does, a consumer
                            of this field might not want to use the altered
                            semantics.  Allowing versions in the syntax
                            is a way to indicate this and let the consumer
                            of the header field decide. </t>

                                    of "fail" here permits the receiver of the

                                    A report of "neutral" or "none" preempts
                                    that choice, ensuring the message will
                                    be treated as if it had not been

                                <t> These result codes are used in the context
                                    of this specification to reflect the result
                                    returned by the component conducting SPF
                                    evaluation. </t>

                                <t> Similarly, the results for Sender ID
                                    are listed and described in Section 4.2 of
                                    <xref target="SENDERID"/>, which in turn
                                    uses the SPF definitions that now appear
				    in <xref target="SPF"/>. </t>

                                <t> Note that both of those documents specify
                                    result codes that use mixed case, but they
                                    are typically used all lowercase in this
                                    context. </t>

                                <t> For SPF, the ptype used is "smtp", and the
				    property is any of "mailfrom", "helo",
				    and "ehlo", since those values are the ones
				    SPF can evaluate.  For Sender ID,
				    the ptype used is "header", and the
				    property will be the name of the header
				    field from which the Purported Responsible
				    Address (see <xref target="PRA"/>) was
				    extracted. </t>

                                <t> In both cases, an additional result of
                                    "policy" is defined, which means the
                                    client was authorized to inject or relay
                                    mail on behalf of the sender's
                                    DNS domain according to the
                                    authentication method's algorithm,
                                    but local policy dictates that the
                                    result is unacceptable.  For example,
                                    "policy" might be used if SPF returns a
                                    "pass" result, but a local policy check
                                    matches the sending DNS domain to one found
                                    in an explicit list of unacceptable
                                    DNS domains (e.g., spammers). </t>

                                <t> If the retrieved sender policies used to
                                    evaluate SPF and Sender ID do not contain
                                    explicit provisions for authenticating the
                                    local-part (see Section 3.4.1 of
                                    <xref target="MAIL"/>) of an address,
                                    the "pvalue" reported along with results
                                    for these mechanisms SHOULD NOT
                                    include the local-part. </t>

                                    such information could be relayed as a

                title="The &quot;iprev&quot; Authentication Method">
                <t> This section defines an additional authentication method
                    called "iprev". </t>

                <t> "iprev" is an attempt to verify that a client
                    appears to be valid based on some DNS queries, which is to
                    say that the IP address is explicitly associated with
                    a domain name.
                    Upon receiving a session initiation of some kind from
                    a client, the IP address of the client peer is queried
                    for matching names (i.e., a number-to-name translation,
                    also known as a "reverse lookup" or a "PTR" record
                    query).  Once that result is acquired, a lookup of each
                    of the names (i.e., a name-to-number translation, or an "A"
                    or "AAAA" record query) thus retrieved is done.  The
                    response to this second check will typically result in at
                    least one mapping back to the client's IP address. </t>

                <t> Expressed as an algorithm: If the client peer's IP
                    address is I, the list of names to which I maps (after a
                    "PTR" query) is the set N, and the union of IP addresses
                    to which each member of N maps (after corresponding "A"
                    and "AAAA" queries) is L, then this test is successful if
                    I is an element of L. </t>

                <t> The response to a PTR query could contain multiple names.
                    To prevent heavy DNS loads, agents performing these queries
                    MUST be implemented such that the number of names evaluated
                    by generation of corresponding A or AAAA queries is limited
                    so as not to be unduly taxing to the DNS infrastructure,
                    though it MAY be configurable by an administrator.
                    As an example, Section 4.6.4 of <xref target="SPF"/> chose
		    a limit of 10 for its implementation of this algorithm. </t>

                <t> "DNS Extensions to Support IP Version 6"
                    (<xref target="DNS-IP6"/>) discusses the query formats for
                    the IPv6 case. </t>

                <t> There is some contention regarding the wisdom and
                    reliability of this test.  For example, in some regions,
                    it can be difficult for this test ever to pass because
                    the practice of arranging to match the forward and
                    reverse DNS is infrequently observed.  Therefore,
                    the precise implementation details of how a verifier
                    performs an "iprev" test are not specified here.  The
                    verifier MAY report a successful or failed "iprev" test
                    at its discretion having done some kind of check of
                    the validity of the connection's identity using DNS.  It is
                    incumbent upon an agent making use of the reported "iprev"
                    result to understand what exactly that particular verifier
                    is attempting to report. </t>

                <t> Extensive discussion of reverse DNS mapping and its
                    implications can be found in "Considerations for the use
                    of DNS Reverse Mapping" (<xref target="DNSOP-REVERSE"/>).
                    In particular, it recommends that applications avoid using
                    this test as a means of authentication or security.  Its
                    presence in this document is not an endorsement but is
                    merely acknowledgement that the method remains common and
                    provides the means to relay the results of that test.  </t>

        <section anchor="adding" title="Adding the Header Field to a Message">
                <t> This specification makes no attempt to evaluate the
                    relative strengths of various message authentication
                    methods that may become available.  The methods listed are
                    an order-independent set; their sequence does not indicate
                    relative strength or importance of one method over another.
                    Instead, the MUA or downstream filter consuming this header
                    field is to interpret the result of each method based on
		    its own knowledge of what that method evaluates. </t>

                <t> Each "method" MUST refer to an authentication method
                    declared in the IANA registry or an extension method
                    as described in <xref target="x_methods"/>, and each
                    "result" MUST refer to a result code declared in the
                    IANA registry or an extension result code as defined
                    in <xref target="x_results"/>.  See
                    <xref target="iana"/> for further information about
                    the registered methods and result codes. </t>

                <t> An MTA compliant with this specification adds this
                    header field (after performing one or more message
                    authentication tests) to indicate which MTA or ADMD
                    performed the test, which test got applied, and what the
                    result was.  If an MTA applies more than one such test,
                    it adds this header field either once per test or
                    once indicating all of the results.  An MTA MUST NOT add
                    a result to an existing header field. </t>

                <t> An MTA MAY add this header field containing only the
                    authentication identifier portion and the "none" token
                    (see <xref target="format_formal"/>) to indicate explicitly
                    that no message authentication schemes were applied prior
                    to delivery of this message. </t>

                <t> An MTA adding this header field has to take steps to
		    identify it as legitimate to the MUAs or downstream
		    filters that will ultimately consume its content.  One
		    process to do so is described in <xref target="removing"/>.
                    Further measures may be necessary in some environments.
                    Some possible solutions are enumerated in
                    <xref target="forged_headers"/>.  This document does not
                    mandate any specific solution to this issue as each
                    environment has its own facilities and limitations. </t>

                <t> Most known message authentication methods focus on a
                    particular identifier to evaluate.  SPF and Sender ID
                    differ in that they can yield a result based on more
                    than one identifier; specifically, SPF can evaluate
                    the RFC5321.HELO parameter or the RFC5321.MailFrom
                    parameter, and Sender ID can evaluate the
                    RFC5321.MailFrom parameter or the Purported Responsible
                    Address (PRA) identity.  When
                    generating this field to report those results, only the
                    parameter that yielded the result is included. </t>

                <t> For MTAs that add this header field, adding header
                    fields in order (at the top), per Section 3.6 of
                    <xref target="MAIL"/>, is particularly important.
                    Moreover, this header field SHOULD be inserted above any
                    other trace header fields such MTAs might prepend.  This
                    placement allows easy detection of header fields that can
		    be trusted. </t>

                <t> End users making direct use of this header field might
                    inadvertently trust information that has not been properly
                    vetted.  If, for example, a basic SPF
                    result were to be relayed that claims an authenticated
                    addr-spec, the local-part of that addr-spec has actually
                    not been authenticated.  Thus, an MTA adding this
                    header field SHOULD NOT include any data that has not
                    been authenticated by the method(s) being applied. 
                    Moreover, MUAs SHOULD NOT render to users such information
                    if it is presented by a method known not to authenticate
                    it. </t>

                <section anchor="position"
                         title="Header Field Position and Interpretation">
                        <t> In order to ensure non-ambiguous results and avoid
                            the impact of false header fields, MUAs and
                            downstream filters SHOULD NOT interpret this header
                            field unless specifically configured to do so by
                            the user or administrator.  That is, this
                            interpretation should not be "on by default".
                            Naturally then, users or administrators ought not
                            activate such a feature unless they are certain
                            the header field will be validly added by an agent
                            within the ADMD that accepts the mail that is
                            ultimately read by
                            the MUA, and instances of the header field
                            appearing to originate within the ADMD but are
                            actually added by foreign MTAs will be removed
                            before delivery. </t>

                        <t> Furthermore, MUAs and downstream filters SHOULD
                            NOT interpret this header field unless the
                            authentication service identifier it bears appears
                            to be one used within its own ADMD as configured
                            by the user or administrator. </t>

                        <t> MUAs and downstream filters MUST ignore any
                            result reported using a "result" not specified in
                            the IANA "Result Code" registry or a "ptype"
                            not listed
                            in the corresponding registry for such values as
                            defined in <xref target="iana"/>.  Moreover, such
                            agents MUST ignore a result indicated for any
                            "method" they do not specifically support. </t>

                        <t> An MUA SHOULD NOT reveal these results to 
                            end users, absent careful human factors design
                            considerations and testing, for the presentation
                            of trust-related materials.
                            For example, an attacker could register
                            examp1e.com (note the digit "one") and send
                            signed mail to intended victims; a verifier
                            would detect that the signature was valid and
                            report a "pass" even though it's clear the
                            DNS domain name was intended to mislead.  See
                            <xref target="misleading"/> for further
                            discussion. </t>

                        <t> As stated in <xref target="format_general"/>,
                            this header field MUST be treated as though
                            it were a trace header field as defined in Section
                            3.6.7 of <xref target="MAIL"/> and
                            hence MUST NOT be reordered and MUST be
                            prepended to the message, so that there is
                            generally some indication upon delivery of where
                            in the chain of handling MTAs the message
                            authentication was done. </t>

                        <t> Note that there are a few message handlers that are
                            only capable of appending new header fields to a
                            message.  Strictly speaking, these handlers are not
                            compliant with this specification.  They can
                            still add the header field to carry authentication

                        <t> Some sites have a local policy that considers any
                            particular authentication policy's non-recoverable
                            failure results (typically "fail" or similar) as
                            justification for rejecting the message.  In such
                            cases, the border MTA SHOULD issue an SMTP
			    rejection response to the message, rather than
			    adding this header field and allowing the message
			    to proceed toward delivery.  This is more
			    desirable than allowing the message to reach an
			    internal host's MTA or spam filter, thus possibly
			    generating a local rejection such as a Delivery
			    Status Notification (DSN) <xref target="DSN"/> to
			    a forged originator.  Such generated rejections
			    are colloquially known as "backscatter". </t>

        <section anchor="removing" title="Removing Existing Header Fields">
                <t> For security reasons, any MTA conforming to this
                    specification MUST delete any discovered instance of
                    this header field that claims, by virtue of its
                    authentication service identifier, to have been added
                    within its trust boundary but that did not come directly
                    from another trusted MTA.  For example, an MTA for
                    example.com receiving a message MUST delete or otherwise
                    obscure any instance of this header field bearing an
                    authentication service identifier indicating that the
		    header field was added within example.com prior to adding
		    its own header fields.  This could mean each MTA will have
		    to be equipped with a list of internal MTAs known to be
                    compliant (and hence trustworthy). </t>

                <t> For simplicity and maximum security, a border MTA could
                    remove all instances of this header field on mail crossing
                    into its trust boundary.  However, this may conflict with
                    the desire to access authentication results performed by
                    trusted external service providers.  It may also invalidate
                    signed messages whose signatures cover external instances
                    of this header field.  A more robust border MTA could
                    allow a specific list of authenticating MTAs whose
                    information is to be admitted, removing the header field
                    originating from all others. </t>

                <t> As stated in <xref target="trust"/>, a formal definition
                    of "trust boundary" is deliberately not made here.  It is
                    entirely possible that a border MTA for example.com will
                    explicitly trust authentication results asserted by
                    upstream host example.net even though they exist in
                    completely disjoint administrative boundaries.  In that
                    case, the border MTA MAY elect not to delete those results;
                    moreover, the upstream host doing some authentication work
                    could apply a signing technology such as
                    <xref target="DKIM"/> on its own results to assure
                    downstream hosts of their authenticity.  An example of
                    this is provided in <xref target="examples"/>. </t>

                <t> Similarly, in the case of messages signed using
                    <xref target="DKIM"/> or other message-signing methods
                    that sign header fields, this removal action could
                    invalidate one or more signatures on the message if they
                    covered the header field to be removed.  This behavior can
                    be desirable since there's little value in validating the
                    signature on a message with forged header fields.
                    However, signing agents MAY therefore elect to omit these
                    header fields from signing to avoid this situation. </t>


                <t> An MTA SHOULD remove any instance of this header field
                    bearing a version (express or implied) that it does not
                    support.  However, an MTA MUST remove such a header
                    field if the <xref target="SMTP"/> connection relaying the
                    message is not from a trusted internal MTA.  This means
                    the MTA needs to be able to understand versions of this
                    header field at least as late as the ones understood by the
                    MUAs or other consumers within its ADMD. </t>

                        <t> An MUA or filter that accesses a mailbox whose
                            messages are handled by a non-conformant MTA, and
                            understands Authentication-Results header fields,
                            could potentially make false conclusions based on
                            forged header fields.  A malicious user or agent
                            could forge a header field using the DNS domain
                            of a receiving ADMD as the authserv-id token
                            in the value of the header field and, with the
                            rest of the value, claim that the message was
                            properly authenticated.  The non-conformant MTA
                            would fail to strip the forged header field, and
                            the MUA could inappropriately trust it. </t>

                        <t> For this reason, it is best not to have

                            field enabled by default; instead, it should be

                            filtering decisions, unless specifically enabled
                            by the user or administrator after verifying that
                            the border MTA is compliant.  It is acceptable to
                            have an MUA aware of this specification but have
                            an explicit list of hostnames whose
                            Authentication-Results header

                                    authentication scheme even if a number
                                    of them are in use at the border MTA.
                                    Note that <xref target="DKIM"/> requires
                                    that the From header field be signed,
                                    although in this application, the signing
                                    agent (a trusted MTA) likely cannot
                                    authenticate that value, so the fact that
                                    it is signed should be ignored.  Where
                                    the authserv-id is the ADMD's domain name,
                                    the authserv-id matching this valid

                                    sufficient. </t>

                                <t> Another would be a means to interrogate
                                    the MTA that added the header field to

                                    message authentication services and saw
                                    the message in question, but this isn't
                                    especially palatable given the work
                                    required to craft and implement such a

                                <t> Yet another might be a method to

                                    within an ADMD, thus allowing it to

                                    proposed here should always appear above
                                    a Received header added by a trusted
                                    MTA.  This can be used as a test for

                        <t> In any case, a mechanism needs to exist for an
                            MUA or filter to verify that the host that appears
                            to have added the header field (a) actually did
                            so and (b) is legitimately adding that header
                            field for this delivery.  Given the variety
                            of messaging environments deployed today,
                            consensus appears to be that specifying a
                            particular mechanism for doing so is not
                            appropriate for this document. </t>
                
                        <t> Mitigation of the forged header field attack can
                            also be accomplished by moving the authentication
                            results data into metadata associated with
                            the message.  In particular, an
                            <xref target="SMTP"/> extension could be
                            established to communicate
                            authentication results from the border MTA to
                            intermediate and delivery MTAs; the latter of
                            these could arrange to store the authentication
                            results as metadata retrieved and rendered
                            along with the message by an <xref target="IMAP"/>
                            client aware of a similar extension in that
                            protocol.  The delivery MTA would be told to
                            trust data via this extension only from
                            MTAs it trusts, and border MTAs would not accept
                            data via this extension from any source.  There is
                            no vector in such an arrangement for forgery of
                            authentication data by an outside agent. </t>

        <section anchor="legacy_muas" title="Legacy MUAs">
                <t> Implementers of this protocol should be aware
                    that many MUAs are unlikely to be retrofitted to
                    support the new header field and its semantics.  In
                    the interests of convenience and quicker
                    adoption, a delivery MTA might want to
                    consider adding things that are processed by
                    existing MUAs in addition to the Authentication-Results
                    header field.  One suggestion is to include a Priority
                    header field, on messages that don't already have such a
                    header field, containing a value that reflects the
                    strength of the authentication that was accomplished,
                    e.g., "low" for weak or no authentication, "normal" or
                    "high" for good or strong authentication. </t>

                <t> Some modern MUAs can already filter based on
                    the content of this header field.  However, there is
                    keen interest in having MUAs make some kind of
                    graphical representation of this header field's meaning
                    to end users.  Until this capability is added, other
                    interim means of conveying authentication results may
                    be necessary while this proposal and its successors

                            conforms to this specification.  Once again,
                            the receiving DNS domain name is used as the
                            authserv-id.  Furthermore, the sender

                            via a method specified in <xref target="AUTH"/>,
                            and both SPF and Sender ID checks were done and

                        <t> Two Authentication-Results header fields are

                            using SMTP authentication to prove identity.
                            The dialup provider has been explicitly authorized

                        <t> The Authentication-Results header field is
                            present, indicating conformance to this
                            specification.  Once again, the authserv-id used
                            is the recipient's DNS domain name.  The header
                            field is present twice because two different MTAs
                            in the chain of delivery did authentication tests.
			    The first MTA, mail-router.example.com, reports
 			    that SMTP AUTH and SPF were both used and that
			    the former passed while the latter failed.  In the
			    SMTP AUTH case, additional information is
                            provided in the comment field, which the MUA can
                            choose to render if desired. </t>

                        <t> The second MTA, auth-checker.example.com,
                            reports that it did a Sender ID test (which
                            failed) and a DKIM test (which passed).  Again,
			    additional data about one of the tests is provided
			    as a comment, which the MUA may choose to render.
			    Also noteworthy here is the fact that there is
			    a DKIM signature added by example.com that assured
			    the integrity of the lower Authentication-Results
			    field. </t>

                        <t> Since different hosts did the two sets of
                            authentication checks, the header fields cannot be
                            consolidated in this example. </t>

                        <t> This example illustrates more typical transmission
                            of mail into example.com from a user on a
                            dialup connection example.net.  The user appears
                            to be legitimate as he/she had a valid password
                            allowing authentication at the border MTA using
                            SMTP AUTH.  The SPF and Sender ID tests failed
                            since example.com has not granted example.net
                            authority to relay mail on its behalf.  However,
                             the DKIM test passed because
                            the sending user had a private key matching one
                            of example.com's published public keys and
                            used it to sign the message. </t>

                        </figure>

                        <t> In this example, we see multi-tiered authentication
                            with an extended trust boundary. </t>

                        <t> The message was sent from someone at example.com's
                            New York office (newyork.example.com) to a
                            mailing list managed at an intermediary.
                            The message was signed at the origin using
                            DKIM. </t>

                        <t> The message was sent to a mailing list service
                            provider called example.net, which is used by
                            example.com.  There, meetings@example.net
                            is expanded to a long list of recipients, one
                            of whom is at the Chicago office.  In this
                            example, we will assume that the trust boundary
                            for chicago.example.com includes the mailing list
                            server at example.net. </t>

                        <t> The mailing list server there first authenticated
                            the message and affixed an
                            Authentication-Results header field indicating
                            such using its DNS domain name for the authserv-id.
                            It then altered the message by affixing some
                            footer text to the body, including some
                            administrivia such as unsubscription
                            instructions.  Finally, the mailing list server
                            affixes a second DKIM signature
                            and begins distribution of the message. </t>

                        <t> The border MTA for chicago.example.com explicitly
                            trusts results from mail-router.example.net,
                            so that header field is not removed.  It performs
                            evaluation of both signatures and determines
                            that the first (most recent) is a "pass" but,
                            because of the aforementioned modifications, the
                            second is a "fail".  However, the first
                            signature included the Authentication-Results
                            header added at mail-router.example.net
                            that validated the second signature.
                            Thus, indirectly, it can be determined that
                            the authentications claimed by both signatures are
                            indeed valid. </t>

                        <t> Note that two styles of presenting metadata about
                            the result are in use here.  In one case, the
                            "reason=" clause is present, which is intended
                            for easy extraction by parsers; in the other
                            case, the CFWS production of the ABNF is used
                            to include such data as a header field
                            comment.  The latter can be harder for parsers
                            to extract given the varied supported syntaxes of
                            mail header fields. </t>

        <section anchor="op_considerations"
                title="Operational Considerations about Message Authentication">
                <t> This protocol is predicated on the idea that authentication
                    (and presumably in the future, reputation) work is
                    typically done by border MTAs rather than MUAs or
                    intermediate MTAs; the latter merely make use of the
                    results determined by the former.  Certainly this is
                    not mandatory for participation in electronic mail or
                    message authentication, but this protocol
                    and its deployment to date are based on that model.  The
                    assumption satisfies several common ADMD requirements:

                    <list style="numbers">
                        <t> Service operators prefer to resolve the handling
                            of problem messages as close to the border of the
                            ADMD as possible.  This enables, for example,
                            rejection of messages at the SMTP level rather
                            than generating a DSN internally.  Thus, doing any
                            of the authentication or reputation work
                            exclusively at the MUA or intermediate MTA renders
                            this desire unattainable. </t>

                        <t> Border MTAs are more likely to have direct access
                            to external sources of authentication or reputation
                            information since modern MUAs are more likely to
                            be heavily firewalled.  Thus, some MUAs might not
                            even be able to complete the task of performing
                            authentication or reputation evaluations without
                            complex proxy configurations or similar
                            burdens. </t>

                        <t> MUAs rely upon the upstream MTAs within their trust
                            boundaries to make correct (as much as is
                            possible) evaluations about the message's envelope,
                            header, and content.  Thus, MUAs don't need to
                            know how to do the work that upstream MTAs do;
                            they only need the results of that work. </t>

                        <t> Evaluations about the quality of a message,
                            from simple token matching (e.g., a list of
                            preferred DNS domains) to cryptanalysis (e.g.,
                            public/private key work), are at least a
                            little bit expensive and thus need to be minimized.
                            To that end, performing those tests at the border
                            MTA is far preferred to doing that work at each
                            MUA that handles a message.  If an ADMD's
                            environment adheres to common messaging protocols,
                            a reputation query or an authentication check
                            performed by a border MTA would return the same
                            result as the same query performed by an MUA.  By
                            contrast, in an environment where the MUA does the
                            work, a message arriving for multiple recipients
                            would thus cause authentication or reputation
                            evaluation to be done more than once for the same
                            message (i.e., at each MUA), causing needless
                            amplification of resource use and creating a
                            possible denial-of-service attack vector. </t>

                        <t> Minimizing change is good.  As new authentication
                            and reputation methods emerge, the list of methods
                            supported by this header field would presumably be
                            extended.  If MUAs simply consume the contents of
                            this header field rather than actually attempt
                            to do authentication and/or reputation work, then
                            MUAs only need to learn to parse this header field
                            once; emergence of new methods requires only a
                            configuration change at the MUAs and software
                            changes at the MTAs (which are presumably fewer in
                            number).  When choosing to implement these
                            functions in MTAs vs. MUAs, the issues of
                            individual flexibility, infrastructure inertia, and
                            scale of effort must be considered.  It is
                            typically easier to change a single MUA than an
                            MTA because the modification affects fewer users
                            and can be pursued with less care.  However,
                            changing many MUAs is more effort than changing a
                            smaller number of MTAs.  </t>

                        <t> For decisions affecting message delivery and
                            display, assessment based on authentication and
                            reputation is best performed close to the time of
                            message transit, as a message makes its journey
                            toward a user's inbox, not afterwards.  DKIM keys
                            and IP address reputations, etc., can change over
                            time or even become invalid, and users can take
                            a long time to read a message once delivered.
                            The value of this work thus degrades, perhaps
                            quickly, once the delivery process has completed.
                            This seriously diminishes the value of this work
                            when done other than at MTAs. </t>
                    </list> </t>

                <t> Many operational choices are possible within an ADMD,
                    including the venue for performing authentication and/or
                    reputation assessment.  The current specification does not
                    dictate any of those choices.  Rather, it facilitates those
                    cases in which information produced by one stage of
                    analysis needs to be transported with the message to the
                    next stage.  </t>
