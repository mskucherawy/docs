    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes how some MTA software can be made to fall back to IPv4 when a message is refused over IPv6</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Under <xref target="RFC5321">RFC&nbsp;5321</xref>, the process of target host selection is described. SMTP clients in well know MTA software will retry to send a message at a different MX RR or IP Address if the message is temporarly rejected. This document describes under which circumstances these MTAs can be made to retry over IPv4. This behavior could be useful for instance in enforcing higher requirements for SMTP over IPv6 than what exists on IPv4 while not simply rejecting outright the message.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="Moving from IP reputation to domain based reputation">
      <t>IPv6 brings more IP addresses, building an IP based reputation system using IPv6 addresses could be difficult to achieve. Moving from an IP based reputation systems to a domain based reputation system could be easier. However it requires that all SMTP servers participate. With IPv6 there is a chance to mandate SPF (<xref target="RFC6652">RFC&nbsp;6652</xref>) or DKIM (<xref target="RFC6376">RFC&nbsp;6376</xref>) for messages sent over IPv6 and if not to be retried over IPv4.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Configuration for common opensource MTA">
      <section title="MX RR configuration">
        <t>When a message is temporarly refused the strategy for the SMTP client is to sometimes retry immediately to a different MX</t>
        <t>When the MX RR points to a dual stacked machine, some MTA software will not pick up all the A or AAAA RR but the RR which is preferred as per the IP stack, therefore it is important to not have any MX RR point to dual stacked machines.</t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>For instance the following configuration is desired:</preamble>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
      example.org.            IN MX   10  mx1.example.org.
                              IN MX   10 mx1-6.example.org.
      mx1.example.org.        IN A    192.0.2.1
      mx1-6.example.org.      IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::1
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>In this configuration, the SMTP clients see two MXes of same priority, and will automatically pick one or the other and try the other one if the message is properly temp failed.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Rejecting messages for immediate retry on IPv4">
        <t>SMTP clients only interpret SMTP status codes, but the use of SMTP enhanced status codes can be used to better monitor and act on the reason of the temporary failure.</t>
        <t>The SMTP client SHOULD be presented with a temporary failure code 4xx at the end of DATA for the message to be retried.</t>
        <t>If the SMTP client is presented with a permanent failure code 5xx during connection, some MTA software will declare the message non deliverable, instead of retrying it on a different MX.</t>
        <t>At connection time if the SMTP server reject using the code 451 and disconnect, the SMTP client will retry the message immediately on a different MX.</t>
        <t>At the end of data if the SMTP server reject using the code 421 and disconnect, the SMTP client will retry the message immediately on a different MX.</t>
        <t>For instance, at the end of DATA, if the message was sent over IPv6, the SMTP server can evalute if the message passes SPF or DKIM and reject the message using 421 if none pass. If one pass, then we have an authenticated domain where we can apply domain reputation rules. The IPv6 of the SMTP client can be noted, and futher connections over IPv6 can be temporary rejected using 451 status code for a certain time period as to minimize resources to evaluate each message after the end of DATA. If a message coming from a defined IPv6 address does not have SPF or DKIM, it is unlikely that this state would quickly change for the next message coming from this IP.</t>
        <t>This behavior has been observed for well known opensource MTAs.</t>
        <t>For proprietary mail systems or large mailbox providers, they all do a form of domain authentication, either SPF or DKIM, so the above may not apply to them. Not all are yet enabled to send email over IPv6.</t>
        <figure>
          <preamble>Here is an example of an initial message sent over IPv6. The SMTP client then retries immediately on the next MX record, here an IPv4 address.</preamble>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
