    <abstract>
      <t>This Applicability Statement describes how Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) can be encouraged to fall back to IPv4 when a message is refused over IPv6.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The process of target host selection appears in <xref target="RFC5321"/>.  SMTP clients in well known Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) software will retry a message using a different Mail Exchanger (MX) or network address if the message is temporarily rejected.  This document describes under which circumstances these MTAs can be made to retry over IPv4 when an initial connection to IPv6 results in a temporary rejection.  This behavior could be useful in, for instance, enforcing higher requirements for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) sessions  over IPv6 than what exists on IPv4 without simply rejecting the message outright.</t>

    </section>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>

    <section title="Moving from IP Reputation to Domain Based Reputation">
      <t>IPv6 brings more IP addresses, which means building an IP-based reputation system using IPv6 addresses will be difficult to achieve.  Moving from an IP based reputation system to a domain based reputation system is expected to  be easier.  However, it requires that all SMTP servers participate. </t>

      <t>As IPv6 is still relatively nascent, there is a chance to mandate use of the Sender Policy Framework (SPF, <xref target="RFC4408"/>) or DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM, <xref target="RFC6376"/>) for messages sent over IPv6 and, if these fail, to do retries over IPv4.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Indicating the sender-SMTP server to fall back to IPv4">
      <t>To move from IP based reputation to a domain based reputation system for email, a receiver-SMTP MAY require that messages pass SPF (<xref target="RFC6652">RFC&nbsp;6652</xref>) or DKIM (<xref target="RFC6376">RFC&nbsp;6376</xref>). This section does not discuss the merit of such policy but proposes mechanisms for any policy to get the sender-SMTP to fall back to IPv4 from an IPv6 connection.</t>
      <section title="With the service extension IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK ">
        <t>The receiver-SMTP MAY addvertise a service extension IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK , which the sender-SMTP MUST reply by IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK if capable</t>
        <t>In this condition for each message not acceptable due to policy where a retry over IPv4 is requested, the sender-SMTP server MUST reply by the reply code 456, where the sender-SMTP MUST requeue the message for immediate retry over IPv4.</t>
        <t>The SMTP enhanced status code SHOULD be 4.4.8.</t>
        <t>456 The receiver-SMTP is requiring the sender-SMTP to retry immediately the message over IPv4.</t>
        <t>The SMTP status code 456 is introduced in this document, and has a very specific meaning associated to the service extension. The SMTP enhanced status code is also introduced in this document, but like all enhanced status codes, they are usually not interpreted by the SMTP client, but for the bounce processor as to provide more meaningful reports to the mail administrator.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Without service extension">
        <t>The sender-SMTP server MUST have MX RR pointing to single stack hostnames and for same MX RR preference MUST point to at least an IPv4 hostname and an IPv6 hostname.</t> 
        <t>The receiver-SMTP server MAY reject a message sent over IPv6 and request the sender-SMTP to retry over IPv4. In such case the SMTP reject code SHOULD be 451 if done at connection time and 421 if done later. The SMTP enhanced status code SHOULD be 4.4.8.</t>
        <t>The rejection at connection time MAY be issued only when it has been demonstrated that a majority of messages would not pass the policy and that the sender-SMTP is not capable of the service extension IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK.</t>
        <t>The rejection at connection time SHOULD be for a limited time to give a chance for later messages to be re-evaluted against the policy.</t>
        <t>456 is not used here, as it is a new SMTP status code introduced for clients that understand the service extension IPV6-IPV4-FALLBACK. It is not sure that sender-SMTP without the this service extension would behave as expected with a new SMTP status code.</t>
        <t>Research presented in annexes has shown that common MTA exhibit this behavior.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>SMTP clients might not not fall back to IPv4 when requested (by not implementing this proposal) and keep retrying on IPv6. MTA administrators ought to monitor for such servers, and could whitelist them to accept messages over IPv6 or take other action as appropriate.</t> 
      <t>Messages may start to queue on the sender-SMTP side and the mail administrator may not notice it or take appropriate action in time.</t>
      <t>If the policy is not explained clearly the mail administrator may not know what is required to pass the policy.</t>
      <t>If the policy is to cumbersome and is not based on widely adopted standards and recommendations, the mail administrator may decide not to jump through hoops to get the email delivered.</t>
      <t>The fall back mechanism without service extension may create unecessary burden for the sender as well as the receiver.</t>

      <section title="Common Open Source MTA Design">
        <t> This secton discusses current implementations in common open source
    MTAs. </t>

        <t>Some observations:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>When presented with a permanent failure code (5yz) during connection establishment, some MTA clients will declare the message non deliverable instead of retrying it on a different MX.</t>
          <t>When an SMTP server rejects during the connection phase using the code 451 and disconnects, the SMTP client will typically retry the message immediately on a different MX.</t>
          <t>When an SMTP server rejects after the DATA phase using a 421 SMTP reply code followed by a disconnect, the code 421 and disconnect, the SMTP client will retry the message immediately on a different MX.</t>
        </list></t>

        <section title="Rejecting Messages for Immediate Retry on IPv4">
        <t>SMTP clients only interpret SMTP status codes, but the use of SMTP enhanced status codes can be used to better monitor and act on the reason of the temporary failure.</t>

        <t>For instance, at the end of DATA, if the message was sent over IPv6, the SMTP server can evalute whether the message passes SPF or DKIM and reject the message using 421 if neither pass.  If one passes, then an authenticated domain name is available and domain reputation rules can be applie. The IPv6 address of the SMTP client can be noted, and futher connections over IPv6 can be temporarily failed using the 451 status code for some period of time period so as to minimize resources to evaluate each message after the end of DATA.  On the other hand, if a message coming from an IPv6 address does not pass SPF or DKIM, it is unlikely that this state would quickly change for the next message coming from the same network address.</t>

        <t>For proprietary mail systems or large mailbox providers, they all do a form of domain authentication, either SPF or DKIM, so the above may not apply to them. Not all are yet enabled to send email over IPv6.</t>
        <figure>

          <preamble>Here is an example of an initial message sent over IPv6. The SMTP client then retries immediately on the next MX record, here an IPv4 address. "S" indicates text sent by a server, and "C" indicates text sent by a client.  Line terminations are omitted in this illustration. </preamble>

        <section title="MX RR configuration">
          <t>When a message is temporarily refused, using a 400-series SMTP error code, the strategy for the SMTP client is sometimes to retry immediately to a different MTA, as defined by the target selection process defined in <xref target="RFC5321"/>. </t>

          <t>When the new MX refers to a dual-stacked machine (see <xref target="RFC3974"/>), some MTA software will not pick up all of the A or AAAA RRs (Resource Records), but will instead select only the RRs matching the address family preferred by the local TCP/IP implementation.  Thus, MX RRs SHOULD NOT refer to dual-stacked machines.</t>

          <figure>

          ]]></artwork>
          </figure>
          <t>In this configuration, the SMTP clients see two MXes at the same precedence, and will automatically pick one and try the other one if the message is properly temp-failed.  [MSK: But isn't that what you want to happen?] </t>
