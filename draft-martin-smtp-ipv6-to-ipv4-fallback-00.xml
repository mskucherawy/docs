    <abstract>
      <t>This Applicability Statement describes how Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) can be encouraged to fall back to IPv4 when a message is refused over IPv6.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The process of target host selection appears in <xref target="RFC5321"/>.  SMTP clients in well known Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) software will retry a message using a different Mail Exchanger (MX) or network address if the message is temporarily rejected.  This document describes under which circumstances these MTAs can be made to retry over IPv4 when an initial connection to IPv6 results in a temporary rejection.  This behavior could be useful in, for instance, enforcing higher requirements for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) sessions  over IPv6 than what exists on IPv4 without simply rejecting the message outright.</t>

    </section>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>

    <section title="Moving from IP Reputation to Domain Based Reputation">
      <t>IPv6 brings more IP addresses, which means building an IP-based reputation system using IPv6 addresses will be difficult to achieve.  Moving from an IP based reputation system to a domain based reputation system is expected to  be easier.  However, it requires that all SMTP servers participate. </t>

      <t>As IPv6 is still relatively nascent, there is a chance to mandate use of the Sender Policy Framework (SPF, <xref target="RFC4408"/>) or DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM, <xref target="RFC6376"/>) for messages sent over IPv6 and, if these fail, to do retries over IPv4.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Common Open Source MTA Design">
      <t> This secton discusses current implementations in common open source
	  MTAs. </t>

	<t>Some observations:
	<list style="symbols">
        <t>When presented with a permanent failure code (5yz) during connection establishment, some MTA clients will declare the message non deliverable instead of retrying it on a different MX.</t>
        <t>When an SMTP server rejects during the connection phase using the code 451 and disconnects, the SMTP client will typically retry the message immediately on a different MX.</t>
        <t>When an SMTP server rejects after the DATA phase using a 421 SMTP reply code followed by a disconnect, the code 421 and disconnect, the SMTP client will retry the message immediately on a different MX.</t>
	</list></t>
    </section>

      <section title="Rejecting Messages for Immediate Retry on IPv4">
        <t>SMTP clients only interpret SMTP status codes, but the use of SMTP enhanced status codes can be used to better monitor and act on the reason of the temporary failure.</t>

        <t>For instance, at the end of DATA, if the message was sent over IPv6, the SMTP server can evalute whether the message passes SPF or DKIM and reject the message using 421 if neither pass.  If one passes, then an authenticated domain name is available and domain reputation rules can be applie. The IPv6 address of the SMTP client can be noted, and futher connections over IPv6 can be temporarily failed using the 451 status code for some period of time period so as to minimize resources to evaluate each message after the end of DATA.  On the other hand, if a message coming from an IPv6 address does not pass SPF or DKIM, it is unlikely that this state would quickly change for the next message coming from the same network address.</t>

        <t>For proprietary mail systems or large mailbox providers, they all do a form of domain authentication, either SPF or DKIM, so the above may not apply to them. Not all are yet enabled to send email over IPv6.</t>
        <figure>

          <preamble>Here is an example of an initial message sent over IPv6. The SMTP client then retries immediately on the next MX record, here an IPv4 address. "S" indicates text sent by a server, and "C" indicates text sent by a client.  Line terminations are omitted in this illustration. </preamble>

      </section>

      <section title="MX RR configuration">
        <t>When a message is temporarily refused, using a 400-series SMTP error code, the strategy for the SMTP client is sometimes to retry immediately to a different MTA, as defined by the target selection process defined in <xref target="RFC5321"/>. </t>

        <t>When the new MX refers to a dual-stacked machine (see <xref target="RFC3974"/>), some MTA software will not pick up all of the A or AAAA RRs (Resource Records), but will instead select only the RRs matching the address family preferred by the local TCP/IP implementation.  Thus, MX RRs SHOULD NOT refer to dual-stacked machines.</t>

        <figure>
          <preamble>For instance, the following configuration is desired:</preamble>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
      example.org.            IN MX   10  mx1.example.org.
                              IN MX   10 mx1-6.example.org.
      mx1.example.org.        IN A    192.0.2.1
      mx1-6.example.org.      IN AAAA 2001:db8:ffff::1
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>In this configuration, the SMTP clients see two MXes at the same precedence, and will automatically pick one and try the other one if the message is properly temp-failed.  [MSK: But isn't that what you want to happen?] </t>
