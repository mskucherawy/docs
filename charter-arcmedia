Archive formats are used to aggregate multiple files and other data
into a single object, often with data compression and/or confidentiality
protection (encryption).  This working group will create an "archive"
top-level media type.

There has been recent work to register media types for archive formats such
as .tar (a POSIX standard format).  There are already several similar media
types for archive formats, such as .gzip. and .zip. (see, for example,
RFC6713), all of which are registered under the top-level media type
"application".

We create top-level media types only rarely, only with Standards Track RFCs,
and only when one or more media types get special (or common, in the case
of more than one) handling that does not fit under an existing top-level
media type.  RFC6838 defines this process.

The working group will use draft-seantek-kerwin-arcmedia-type as its
initial input.  It will specify rules for registering subtypes under that
new top-level type, considering at a minimum the issue of type suffixes,
fragment identifiers, and internationalization.  The W3C TAG work on
packaging and archives, currently in progress, will also be considered.

Either in that same document or in one or more follow-on documents, it
will produce an initial set of registrations under the new top-level
media type.

The main document will include an Implementation Status section, described
by RFC6982, to record known projects that will either produce or consume
content using the new media type.  If by the first milestone there appears
to be no implementations of the new media type expected, the working group
will fold having produced no RFCs.

No other work is in scope for this working group.

Milestones:
- Jun 2015: Base document
- Dec 2015: Registrations document (if separate)
